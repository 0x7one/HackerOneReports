The resource injection is shown in the attached screenshots:
1: OOB Request and Response to initiate OOB.jpg: This shows the initial request to ---redacted-- with the collaborator hostname I used within the "/cdn-CGI/pe/bag2?r[]=" parameter. It also shows the final response including data injected by my collaborator host.

2: OOB IP Address.jpg: This shows the IP address that contacted my collaborator host, this is a Cloudflare host I believe.
