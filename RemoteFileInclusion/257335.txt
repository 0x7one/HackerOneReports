Summary:

**Summary:** Vulnerabilities in OpenSSH Session Hijacking Vulnerability is a Medium risk vulnerability that is one of the most frequently found on networks around the world. This issue has been around since at least 1990 but has proven either difficult to detect, difficult to resolve or prone to being overlooked entirely.

 

**Description:** You are running a version of OpenSSH which is older.

Versions prior than 7.5 or above are vulnerable to an off by one error
that allows local users to gain root access, and it may be
possible for remote users to similarly compromise the daemon
for remote access.

In addition, a vulnerable SSH client may be compromised by
connecting to a malicious SSH daemon that exploits this
vulnerability in the client code, thus compromising the
client system.An attacker may use this flaw to set up a brute force attack against
the remote host.
1. Session Hijacking
2.Remote file inclusion(high)
3.Brute force attack

## Steps To Reproduce:

Solution : Upgrade to OpenSSH 7.5 or apply the patch for
prior versions.
