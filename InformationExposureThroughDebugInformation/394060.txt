Summary:

**Summary:** 
The application app.passit.io is vulnerable against username enumeration through the use of error messages and dictionary attack.

**Description:**
We noted that the application uses GET request with a rate limit of 60 seconds which is too broad. The application returns an error message that shows detailed information about security features such as throttling time.

Error Message
``{"detail":"Request was throttled. Expected available in 56 seconds."}``

```
{"detail":"Request was throttled. Expected available in 11 seconds."}
```

```

**Recommended Migitation**
Remove the information from the GET response with the number of seconds for throttling and also perform a restriction of IP from enumeration by using IP blacklisting.

## Impact

By having knowledge of the number of messages and the throttling through the use of CURL command. 
It is possible to script a enumeration script to bypass the throttling security feature by checking for the value " Expected available " and perform a sleep after a random number of second to perform the enumeration again.
