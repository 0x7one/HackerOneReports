Summary:

##Description
Hello. This stored XSScase is different from early reported #280495, but has a very similar root cause and reproduction steps.

Upon pasting the link to the Text Object (not in the `Add Media` section, like in previous report), we can intercept the request, and change the link source to the malicious - which will result to the Stored XSS
{F230787}

##POC

Click on the text in the block `2. Question`
{F230788}
You will be XSSed.

##Reproduction steps
1. Create some infographic
2. Use some text object and add the link to it, for example, `http://google.com`:
{F230789}
3. Start web debugger, and enable interception mode.
4. Insert the link
5. Catch the request to the 
```
https://infogram.com/api/infographics/update/[_your_project_id]
```
and change 
```
http://google.com
```
to the
```
javascript:alert(document.domain)
```
{F230790}
6. Execute the request, and make infographic Public
7. Visit it and click the text object to ensure that XSS works.

##Suggested fix
Check the inserted links on the server side - they must start with the pattern `http[s]://`
