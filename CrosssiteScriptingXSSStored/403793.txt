Summary:

Hello KhanAcademy Security Team,

I'm **rootbakar**, I found an XSS bug on 'BIO' in the profile, I used payload XSS **"/><svg/on<script>load=prompt(document.domain);>"/><svg/on<script>load= prompt (document.cookie);>** after I save it appears there is no trigger from the XSS, but when I try to change one of the values in the profile form and when I save it again an XSS trigger appears but with the words '**undefined**'. Every time I want to change both '**REAL NAME**' and '**LOCATION**' and when I press the save button again and after a few seconds an XSS trigger appears with the words '**undefined**'
