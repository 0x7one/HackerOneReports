Summary:

Hi, just like the report #237927, I found stored XSS in Templates>Enhance> Social Badges section.

1. Go to templates section and click on one of your templates.
2. Enhance> Social Badges.
3. Enter the payload: javascript:alert(1) in any of the social networking button url.
4. You'll see that the xss is being triggered.

Note: The similar social sections in Call to Action button are not accepting this payload, so but this is not fixed in Social Badges section.

Thanks.
