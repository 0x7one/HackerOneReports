Summary:

Hai,
I've found a stored xss vulnerability via assets but unfortunately its been blocked by CSP.

Steps to reproduce:-
1) Add a asset like "><img src=x onerror=prompt``>
{  
  i) Go to program --> scope --> Add asset --> select 'Others' and give "><img src=x onerror=prompt``>
  ii) Check your console now.
}
2) Then, Go to the created program. (You can check with this https://hackerone.com/script_src_x_img_src_x_onerror)
3) Click the created asset. [xss will be fired now(1)]
4) Then submit a report.
5) Whenever the asset is rendering, xss is firing actually(2).
6) Then, open the submitted report. (xss will be firing here too[3])
7) Then click 'edit' in assets, (xss will be firing here too(4))

## Impact

Script can be executing for all.
