Summary:

issue: xss(stored)
Stored XSS occurs when a web application gathers input from a user which might be malicious, and then stores that input in a data store for later use. The stored input is not correctly filtered. As a consequence, the malicious data will appear to be part of the web site and run within the user’s browser under the privileges of the web application.
