Summary:

# Summary
---

www.learnboost.com is vulnerable to stored XSS via ZIP codes stored alongside school names in the *Network* panel. 

# Browsers Verified In
---

* Mozilla Firefox 58.0b12 (64-bit)

# PoC

Visit https://www.learnboost.com/settings/network/search and search for `fro`. My entry will trigger the XSS payload.

```html
"><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>
```

## Impact

I now have stored XSS that triggers whenever someone searches for `fro`. If I were to map the payload to a very common search term (e.g. `aa`) that would increase the likelihood that my payload would fire.
