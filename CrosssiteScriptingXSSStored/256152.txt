Summary:
When creating new tags on Tealium, the application did not check that the user creating the tag had authorized as the same account they were creating a tag for. It was possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary content into a web page using the `utag.js` tag. Depending on how the victim implemented these tags, this could potentially allow for text injection, content injection, and HTML injection into the DOM, and even cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. Although Uber does not own Tealium, we pay our bounties based on impact. Since we had widely implemented this on many different uber.com domains, we awarded a bounty in line with this bugâ€™s impact. We also communicated with the Tealium team to patch this vulnerability for all other Tealium users.
