WeaknessName:Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored
Reporter:https://hackerone.com/ysx
ReportedTo:Weblate(weblate)
BountyAmount:
Severity:low
State:Closed

Summary:

Hi,

Input validation and/or sanitisation is not currently applied to the "Editor Link" in the user's [Preferences](https://demo.weblate.org/accounts/profile/#preferences). Consequently, it is possible to store a JavaScript payload which is stored and executes in the Weblate instance context.

{F178717}

## Steps to reproduce
1. Visit the above Preferences page and identify the Editor Link field
2. Populate the field with: `javascript:confirm(document.domain)`
3. Visit a [translation page](https://demo.weblate.org/translate/hello/master/zh_CN/?checksum=6412684aaf018e8e) and select a Source String Location
4. The XSS will trigger upon clicking on a Source String (e.g. `main.c`)

Thanks!
