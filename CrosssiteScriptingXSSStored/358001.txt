Summary:

Allows me to change the profile name to an image tag <img src="........"/> and convert it into an html code and this tag appears perfectly on the "snippets" page.

Suppose I include an image tag with source <img src="http://progress28.web.id/abc.jpg"> and when another user sees it on the "https://gitlab.com/snippets/1718284" page it will appear an image of an anonymous.

I can also add a header tag in the profile name with the tag "<h1>HACKED BY TALAOHU28</h1>" and will look perfect on the same page "https://gitlab.com/snippets/1718284".

Other tags that run perfectly include:
</br>
<div></div>
<a href=""></a>
<b></b>


Here's the complete payload I've made as the profile name

</br><h1>HACKED BY TALAOHU28</h1><img src="http://progress28.web.id/abc.jpg"></br><h1>I WANT TO BACK FREE</h1></br>

## Impact

other users can see the page "https://gitlab.com/snippets/1718284" as if being hacked by hackers
