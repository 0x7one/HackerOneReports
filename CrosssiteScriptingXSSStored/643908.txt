Summary:
Ali found a stored XSS vulnerability in the JavaScript implementation of workflow keywords on our Trac instance. The issue was caused by using unescaped user input to generate a delete button. [A fix has been implemented](https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/9048) to use the safe jQuery method `.attr()` instead.

Important: As mentioned in our [policy](https://hackerone.com/wordpress), **do not pentest our Trac instances**, it's very annoying to clean up after. Setup a local environment instead; the custom source code is available via Git (`git clone git://meta.git.wordpress.org/`), in the trac.wordpress.org subfolder. **If you ignore this you'll forfeit any bounty.**
Hi there,
I found a stored xss @ https://core.trac.wordpress.org/

Steps:
1. Go to https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ and login. (open new private window and login with another account)
2. Go to https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket and set a summary and description.
3. Select a Workflow Keyword and click manual. Paste the payload: "><svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>
4. Click enter button and click Create Ticket button. Now, you will see xss alert.
Copy the url and go to private window. Go to url and you will see xss alert.
