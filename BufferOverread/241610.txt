Summary:
The HTTP strict parsing changes added in 2.2.32 and 2.4.24 introduced a bug in token list parsing, which allows ap_find_token() to search past the end of its input string. By maliciously crafting a sequence of request headers, an attacker may be able to cause a segmentation fault, or to force ap_find_token() to return an incorrect value.

Description:
The HTTP strict parsing changes added in 2.2.32 and 2.4.24 introduced a
bug in token list parsing, which allows ap_find_token() to search past
the end of its input string. By maliciously crafting a sequence of

or to force ap_find_token() to return an incorrect value.

2.4.25 users should upgrade to 2.4.26.
