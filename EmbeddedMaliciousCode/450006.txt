Summary:

I would like to report a case of malicious package (flat-stream) that made it's way into many other npm packages. One such popular package is `event-stream` (user dominictarr transferred the ownership of an npm module to another user because he wasn't actively maintaining it. That user then added malicious dependency to the package)
