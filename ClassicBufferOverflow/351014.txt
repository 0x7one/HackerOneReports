Summary:

A malformed .BSP can trigger an Access Violation on CS:GO that can lead to arbitrary code execution on a remote computer. I have attached a copy of the malformed .BSP which reliably triggers an Access Violation on CS:GO.

## Impact

An attacker hosting a malicious server could compromise a remote client by having them download a custom map, triggering remote code execution on the victim's computer.
