Debug info
==========
In the same vein as our last two reports, we've found more instances of problematic string concatenation. This crash happens due to a buffer overflow in `yywarning_s`. `strcat` is called without making sure `buf` is large enough. The patch below adds the check.

DOS through crashing the mruby process and probable execution flow control through stack smashing.
