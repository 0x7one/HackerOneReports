Summary:

Steps to reproduce:

1 - Be logged in a account
2 - Go to: https://liberapay.com/{user}/edit/statement
3 - Click on Visualize
4 - Submit (and edit POST parameters to fuzz infinitely)
5 - Wait the server proccess the request.

I send only 2.813.054 characters. 

Improper input size validation...

I'm sorry. The server gets a bit lagged.
My account in website is cardangi, if u guys want to check the characters that I got stored in DB... 

```

## Impact

An attacker can send UNLIMITATED data to the server.
He can do a unlimited fuzzing too.
Affects totally availability, server response...

Maybe null terminators? Who knows.

Basically, no captcha to register, real attack scenario:

1 - Create with a bot 100+ accounts
2 - Send packets of GB's and GB's of strings to the field
3 - Wait for the CHAOS! :]
