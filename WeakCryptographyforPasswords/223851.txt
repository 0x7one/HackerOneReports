Summary:

Hi!,

Following my previous report, #223618, I could see that you made a change to the site which https://demo.weblate.org/accounts/password/ says

>Your password can't be too similar to your other personal information.
>Your password must contain at least 6 characters.
>Your password can't be a commonly used password.
>Your password can't be entirely numeric.
>**Your password can't consist of single character or whitespace only.**

I found that it is possible to create a password with a single character

###Reproduction Steps
- Create a new account
- Load the link sent to your mail
- Now, set password to six spaces(tapping the space bar 6 times) and a letter included
- You'll get a success message.
