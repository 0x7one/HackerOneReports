Summary:

Hi Again!

As seen your website at https://demo.weblate.org/accounts/password/
>Your password can't be too similar to your other personal information.
>Your password must contain at least 6 characters.
>Your password can't be a commonly used password.
>Your password can't be entirely numeric.

I found that it is possible to create a password with `empty spaces`, not useful anyway but renders the password security weak.

##Reproduction Steps
- Create a new account
- Load the link sent to your mail
- Now, set password to six spaces (tapping the space bar 6 times)
- You'll get a success message

##Screenshots
Here are screenshots confirming the vulnerability
