Summary:

Hi ,
I'm sure this repo on GitHub `https://github.com/Hacker0x01` belong to `Hackerone,inc`. I've found that your docs on it mention a Heroku app `breaker101.herokuapp.com
` which is no longer work and I could takeover it via HeroKu.

>Suggested Fix : 
Remove this app name from your docs or I can remove it from my apps to added it back to your account 

#`Poc :` 
http://breaker101.herokuapp.com


>Repo https://github.com/Hacker0x01/Hacker101Coursework/blob/master/gae/static/report47.md
{F450943}

## Impact

>New Researchers can be scammed by this app
