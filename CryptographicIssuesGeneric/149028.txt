Summary:

Hey, I've found that when we use the 'forgot password' page to recover our password, bridge.cspr.ng sends an email to us, and when I tried to get more information about the email from noreply@cspr.ng, I saw that the email is sent in *clear-text* instead of TLS which is so vulnerable since any Man-in-the-middle attacker is able to read these sensitive Emails and get the password reset link -> which can lead to **account takeover**.

You can see in this image that 'no encryption' is used:

--------------
This can further lead to **Account Takeover** that's why I've added [URGENT] in the title.

If you have any other questions or if anything needs clarification, please let me know.

**Thanks,
Ahsan Tahir**
