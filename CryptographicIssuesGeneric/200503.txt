Summary:

Dear Alvosec bug bounty team,

# Summary
---

A PRNG is an algorithm used to produce random-looking numbers with certain desirable statistical properties. In order for a PRNG to be cryptographically secure it must be resistant to prediction.

The `generatepass()` function in [Alvocrypt](https://alvosec.com/alvocrypt/) currently uses `Math.random()` as a pseudo-random number generator which is not a cryptographically secure PRNG.

The PRNG is implemented in `generatepass()` as follows:

~~~
function generatepass(plength) {
    temp = ''
    for (i = 0; i < plength; i++)
        temp += keylist.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * keylist.length))
    return temp
}
~~~

# How can this be fixed?

You could either implement a CPRNG from a library or use the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RandomSource/getRandomValues).

Yours sincerely,
Ed
