Summary:
A flaw in our Credit Card Verification process was reported that could have allowed an attacker to avail themselves of a Xero Subscription without paying for it, for a month at most. This was rated as non-critical and was quickly fixed.  Mitigation measures were in place to detect any abuse and we have no reports of this flaw ever being exploited.
