Summary:

We tested the Android app, v2.0.2

To replicate:

    Install the app, and run it until you reach the login screen.

    Install PacketCapture:
    https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.greyshirts.sslcapture

    Go to PacketCapture, go through setup, SKIP the SSL certificate
    install process

    Activate PacketCapture At this point all network traffic will be
    going through PacketCapture. SSL traffic will be encrypted using a
    self-signed certificate, not trusted by the device.

    Go back to to the app, enter any credentials and try to login.

    In PacketCapture, observe login calls without any SSL being used

You can also replicate this issue with an MITM proxy

Implications is that anybody monitoring the network can see the login credentials
