Summary:
One of our package servers had an old smtpd service linked with openssl 1.0.1i, which uses nondeterministic CBC padding, making it easy for man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain cleartext data via a padding-oracle attack, aka the "POODLE" issue. The service has been disabled for the internet, as it was not necessary to begin with.
