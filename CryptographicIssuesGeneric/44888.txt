Summary:

Hello HackerOne,

I found out that it's easy to publish a program that isn't yours.

``` January 20, 2015 ```
I created a program named *Puffer Bird* and I leave the sandbox to prepare to launch the program.
Then, I requested for a program review.

``` January 21, 2014 at 1:08 AM ```
I received an email from ██████@hackerone. 

>At this time HackerOne is unable to validate the program because of multiple factors. Initial validation can begin by sending an email from the Pufferbird.com to support@hackerone.com. Additional details may be required to confirm your identity and the company.
> 
>Thank you.

So, I went to a [Hosting Website](http://hostinger.ph), I created a New Account to create a domain *pufferbird.com* .

After creating the domain, I created an email *no-reply@pufferbird.com*

Then, I sent an email to ██████@hackerone.com

And It has been sent successfully.


Note:  Because the domain I created is not pointing to host's nameservers, services like email will not work correctly but it can sent an email but not able to receive.

``` January 23, 2015 at 9:17 PM ```
I sent another email directly to ██████@hackerone.com using my own and real email.


``` January 24, 2015 at 12:23 AM ```
I received an email that the program has been approved.

Short Recap:
I made a program
Leave the sandbox to request review
██████@hackerone.com emailed me for validation of the program
I validate the program using the fake pufferbird.com email address
I emailed ██████@hackerone.com that I already sent the email which contains information about the program.
