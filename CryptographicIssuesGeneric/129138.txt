Summary:

When installing New Relic on a new Ubuntu 16.04 (xenial) machine to test out the beta, I noticed this warning:
`W: gpgv:/var/lib/apt/lists/apt.newrelic.com_debian_dists_newrelic_Release.gpg: The repository is insufficiently signed by key B60A3EC9BC013B9C23790EC8B31B29E5548C16BF (weak digest)`

This specifically means that the signature at https://apt.newrelic.com/debian/dists/newrelic/Release.gpg used the SHA-1 digest algorithm.

I downloaded both `Release` and `Release.gpg` and validated this:

```
| => gpg -v --verify Release.gpg Release
gpg: armor header: Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)
gpg: Signature made Thu Mar 17 12:04:33 2016 CDT
gpg:                using DSA key 0xB31B29E5548C16BF
gpg: using PGP trust model
gpg: Good signature from "New Relic <support@newrelic.com>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: B60A 3EC9 BC01 3B9C 2379  0EC8 B31B 29E5 548C 16BF
gpg: binary signature, digest algorithm SHA1
```

Signatures with that GPG key need to be using SHA-2 or better.
