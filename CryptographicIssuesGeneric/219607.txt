Summary:
It is possible under some circumstances to measure responses for authentication attempts, which can be used to assist in brute force attacks. While this issue is real, the actual practical attack is very difficult to carry out.
Dear Dovecot bug bounty team,

Dovecot is vulnerable to timing attacks, because the `verify_credentials()` function in CRAM-MD5 performs a byte-by-byte comparison, which terminates early when two characters do not match.

# Summary
---

Timing attacks are a type of side channel attack where one can discover valuable information by recording the time it takes for a cryptographic algorithm to execute.

### üëé Don't use `memcmp()` here:

~~~
if (i == 0) {
  /* verify response */
  if (memcmp(response_hex, request - > response, 32) != 0) {
    auth_request_log_info( & request - > auth_request,
      AUTH_SUBSYS_MECH,
      "password mismatch");
    return FALSE;
  }
} else {
  request - > rspauth =
    p_strconcat(request - > pool, "rspauth=",
      response_hex, NULL);
}
~~~

The same applies in https://github.com/dovecot/core/blob/master/src/auth/mech-cram-md5.c:

~~~
if (memcmp(response_hex, request - > response, sizeof(digest) * 2) != 0) {
  auth_request_log_info( & request - > auth_request, AUTH_SUBSYS_MECH,
    "password mismatch");
  return FALSE;
}
~~~

`memcmp()` does a byte-by-byte comparison of two values and as soon as the two differentiate it terminates. This means the longer it takes until the operation returns, the more correct characters the attacker has guessed.

### üëç Use this instead:

I would highly recommend you use OpenSSL's `CRYPTO_memcmp()`.

On a side note, this issue appears in other places too, so I will have another thorough look.

Best regards,
