Summary:

I just checked for SPF records for the hackerone.com domain, and there are none, effectively allowing for spam(spoof) to originate from that domain. you can validate by testing yourself here: http://www.kitterman.com/spf/validate.html

i want to show you an attack scenario
An attacker would send a Fake email from security@hackerone.com saying that Please change your password, The victim is aware of phishing attacks, But when he sees that the mail originated from security@hackerone.com , He has no other way than to believe it. Clicking on the link takes him to a website where certain JavaScript is executed which steals his hackerone.com id and pin (SESSION COOKIE). The results can be more dangerous.

<?php
$to = "VICTIM@example.com";
$subject = "Password Change";
$txt = "Change your password by visiting here - [VIRUS LINK HERE]l";
$headers = "From: security@hackerone.com";
mail($to,$subject,$txt,$headers);
?>

v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:sendgrid.net include:mail.zendesk.com include:spf.mandrillapp.com ~all

Checking to see if there is a valid SPF record.

Found v=spf1 record for hackerone.com:
v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:sendgrid.net include:mail.zendesk.com include:spf.mandrillapp.com ~all


Your SPF record is v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:sendgrid.net include:mail.zendesk.com include:spf.mandrillapp.com ~all

It should be v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:sendgrid.net include:mail.zendesk.com include:spf.mandrillapp.com ~all

The problem
The article clearly shows difference between softmail and fail you should be using fail as Softmail allows anyone to send spoofed emails from your domains. in your SPF record you should replace ~ with - at last before all , - is strict which prevents all spoofed emails except if you are sending. Your bug is that you are using ~ , you should use -
