Summary:

Hello sir,

I found a that the web application does not have proper rate limitation on the web application to prevent flooding to the victim's email with invitation emails.
 the attacker can send thousand of unwanted and unknown email saying: 
"You're invited to use Square Appointments 	

Hi,
Please set up your profile to start receiving online bookings."

Attacker can repeat the same about thousand of times and can flood the victims email address using your platform.
Easy to exploit makes it very critical. it would not take more then 1 hour for an attacker to flood the victim's email and the main part is, attacker will send those thousands of email using your platform which is not an acceptable risk.

Steps to repo:
1) Authenticate to the square application. ( attacker's account )
2) Navigate to https://squareup.com/appointments/staff/staff-token
3) add a fake staff member with victim's email.
4) Start a proxy tool like Burp. and turn the interception on. 
5) click save 
6) As soon as you click save, an http request will appear in burp which will be similar to above one but it would consist of your details ( cookie, token etc  ).
7) Send the request to intruder 
8) add payloads.
9) Start attack. Boom!

Suggested fix
A. Add a limit to the number of invitation attempts that can come from a particular IP address every 5 minutes. 
B. Add a Captcha mechanism, which may come after a certain number of emails.
