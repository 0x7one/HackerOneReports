Summary:

Hello security team,

The site legalrobot.com is potentially vulnerable to the BREACH attack.

Allowing an attacker the ability to:
- Inject partial chosen plaintext into a victim's requests
- Measure the size of encrypted traffic
- can leverage information leaked by compression to recover targeted parts of the plaintext.

BREACH (Browser Reconnaissance & Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext) is a category of vulnerabilities and not a specific instance affecting a specific piece of software. To be vulnerable, a web application must:

Be served from a server that uses HTTP-level compression
Reflect user-input in HTTP response bodies
Reflect a secret (such as a CSRF token) in HTTP response bodies

Mitigations to fix this include:
- Disabling HTTP compression
- Separating secrets from user input
- Randomizing secrets per request
- Masking secrets (effectively randomizing by XORing with a random secret per request)
- Protecting vulnerable pages with CSRF
- Length hiding (by adding random number of bytes to the responses)
- Rate-limiting the requests
