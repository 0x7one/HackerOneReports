CVE-2016-2183  

Description : 
A flaw was found in the way the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite.

Problem Location :

Mitigation : 
TLS libraries and applications should limit the length of TLS sessions with a 64-bit cipher.
