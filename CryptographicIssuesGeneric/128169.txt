Summary:
Severity: Moderate

There is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No
EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA
as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not
believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very
difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information
about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources
required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only
accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would
additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target
private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private
key that is shared between multiple clients. For example this can occur by
default in OpenSSL DHE based SSL/TLS ciphersuites.

This issue affects OpenSSL version 1.0.2.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2e

This issue was reported to OpenSSL on August 13 2015 by Hanno
BÃ¶ck. The fix was developed by Andy Polyakov of the OpenSSL
development team.
For certain inputs OpenSSL's BN_mod_exp function (which is used for RSA and Diffie Hellman) can produce wrong results.
The issue has been fixed by OpenSSL and rated moderate severity:
