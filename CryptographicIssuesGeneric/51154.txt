Summary:


www.itbit.com details:


### High Level, description

It is possible for a malicious user to capture credential information of a www.itbit.com user with the use of SSLStrip. The scenario is that if a user is in a internet cafe and browses the internet while a malicious user intercepts his traffic, the way www.itbit.com servers are configured could allow the exposure of this users credential in the clear.

### Steps to reproduce

* (this will be the malicious machine) Use a linux distribution and install the MITMf proxy, available here (https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/MITMf)
* Execute the command with the following syntax (sudo python mitmf.py -i eth0 --spoof --arp --hsts --dns --gateway gatewayIP --target targetIP)
(this will be the legitimate machine) Use a windows machine which will use any browser and connect to the www.itbit.com website, then authenticate, as you can see there is no HTTPS lock in the browser)
* The credentials are entered and the site is navigated all in the clear (HTTP)
* You can see the credentials are intercepted in the MITMf window log.

### Example of captured information :

>com&password=madmantmpassword1234




### Risk :

The risk has been evaluated as critical, since the interception of a user could mean the compromise of his account and could also lead of a potential compromise of an admin account since the system is vulnerable and they could be targeted.

### Mitigation / Corrective Measures :

Disable port 80
Fully use HTTPS in the whole website
Implement HSTS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security)
Adding www.itbit.com inside a certificate whitelist (http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/http/transport_security_state_static.json)

### Example of HSTS on a Apache Server
Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
