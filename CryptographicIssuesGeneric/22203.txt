Summary:

Hi, team.
I found a bug in twitter.com
Description and POC:
1) Create a twitter account having email address "abcd@x.com".
2) Now Logout and ask for password reset link. Don't use the password reset link.
3) Login using the same password back and update your email address to "efgh@x.com" and verify the same.
4) Now logout and use the password reset link which was mailed to "abcd@x.com" in step 2.
5) You can see that it is possible to change the password.
Here  the password reset link of "abcd@x.com" which was old email address associated with twitter can be use to change the password of twitter account having  updated email address "efgh@x.com".

Attack scenario:
If victim's previous "abcd@x.com" account was compromised, he decided to updated his twitter email address to "efgh@x.com" but before updating by mistake he asked for password reset link. As a result his twitter account will be compromised by the attacker.

Fix: As soon as new email address is updated all the previous links should also get expired.

If you want further information please let me know.

Thanks and regards.
