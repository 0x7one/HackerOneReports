Summary:

To the Cuvva security team,
i was going through your website and i thought to look for latest cryptographic issues
as the website uses SSL/TLS i.e,HTTPS

target: https:cuvva.com:443

so i quickly run the nmap with ssl-enum script to look for new Vulnerability that is known as "SWEET32"

detail about sweet32 vuln:~
Cryptographic protocols like TLS, SSH, IPsec, and OpenVPN commonly use block cipher algorithms, such as AES, Triple-DES, and Blowfish, to encrypt data between clients and servers. To use such algorithms, the data is broken into fixed-length chunks, called blocks, and each block is encrypted separately according to a mode of operation. Older block ciphers, such as Triple-DES and Blowfish use a block size of 64 bits, whereas AES uses a block size of 128 bits.

note: this vulnerability and exploitation has been demo'ed at defcon
ref site: https://sweet32.info/

1. run nmap
2.type nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers cuvva.com
3.now hit enter and let it do its work and after it done you will
find that https:443 is vulnerable to sweet32.

TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 both are vulnerable
