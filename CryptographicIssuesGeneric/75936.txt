Summary:

Here  I am addressing Critical misconfiguration in autologin feature 
1. Open the link in the browser https://dashboard.zopim.com/#home and enter your username and password and don't tick (select) the option Always sign in automatically  and login 
2. now logout from your account 
3. now you logged out again reload the page https://dashboard.zopim.com/#home and you will be logged in
here the user does not selected the autologin option but still he./she logged in automatically

attack scenario
lets a user is using his account on local computer so he doesnot selected the autologin option while login 
then his work finished and signout and left after that any one can reload the link and login his/her account
