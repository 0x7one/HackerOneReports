Summary:

One of the SSL certificates used by your SSL server contains a public key less than 2048 bit long. 

New Standard for SSL Certificates Industry standards set by the Certification Authority/Browser (CA/B) Forum require that certificates issued after January 1, 2014 MUST be at least 2048-bit key length.1 As computer power increases, anything less than 2048-bit certificates are at risk of being compromised by hackers with sophisticated processing capabilities. The cybersecurity industry is moving to stronger 2048-bit encryption to help preserve internet security.

The impact of this vulnerability
Any certificate with a public key less than 2048-bit are at risk of being compromised by hackers with sophisticated processing capabilities. 

How to fix this vulnerability
If you have any 1024-bit certificates or certificates with less than 2048-bit key length, you will need to migrate to 2048-bit key length.
