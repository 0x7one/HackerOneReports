Summary:

We know that our mobile number is connected to some subdomains of mail.ru like calendar, cloud and etc.

I found out that using 1 Mobile Number can create or use it to MANY ACCOUNTS.

This is what I did..

I have a main account in mail.ru
Email: atomtheman@mail.ru
with Mobile Number of: 639154219078

Then, I try to use the USED Mobile number in my main to connect to a NEW Account

Email: atomtheman10@gmail.com
with Mobile Number of: 639154219078 [SAME IN MY MAIN ACCOUNT]

so, what is the bug here.. I choose the Information Disclosure Why?
Just what I say Mobile Numbers are connected to some subdomains like calendar, cloud and etc.

Main Account = User #1
New Account = User #2

Scenario:
so let's say in CALENDAR.
User #1 Make a PRIVATE EVENT in his calendar.mail.ru and he checked the SMS to make an aler 15 minutes before the exact event time.

But because of unproper usage of Mobile Number that can use 1 mobile number to multiple accounts

the SECRET EVENT may disclose to User #2.

Get the point?

so my suggestion here is 1 MOBILE NUMBER = 1 ACCOUNT.
