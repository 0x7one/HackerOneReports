##Summary
The **slack.augur.net** record wasn't removed from the DNS after the migration to Discord (**invite.augur.net**) and was pointing to a non-existent page on GitHub Pages. So a subdomain takeover was possible and a proof-of-concept has been done to confirm this.

##Description
Searching for subdomains on **augur.net**, the **slack.augur.net** subdomain was found pointing to Cloudflare, and **http[s]://slack.augur.net** was pointing to a non-existing Github page (pictures attached also):

`[*] Checking DNS.

`[*] Making HTTP/HTTPS request.`

`[+] Unmanaged text 'there isn't a github page' found in response for 'slack.augur.net'! HTTP response is:<!DOCTYPE html>

##PoC
To prove the subdomain take over, a new Github page was made on **sorachiace.github.io** (https://github.com/sorachiace/sorachiace.github.io) and the custom domain was set to point to **slack.augur.net** (pictures attached). The new page works on both HTTP and HTTPS.

**HTTP Request:

`curl http://slack.augur.net/
<html>
<head>
<title>Nothing to see here!</title>
</head>
<body>`

`<p>Nothing to see here!</p>

`</body>
</html>`

**HTTPS Request:**

`curl https://slack.augur.net/
<html>
<head>
<title>Nothing to see here!</title>
</head>
<body>`

`<p>Nothing to see here!</p>

`</body>
</html>`

##Remediation
Make sure to always remove the obsolete DNS records so no subdomains are pointing to external services which are not used anymore.
