Summary:

The `ExportCsvController` allows users to export different types of entities, if one has guardian access:
https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/app/controllers/export_csv_controller.rb#L6

However, the guardian check only checks that the entity type is not "admin":
https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/lib/guardian.rb#L296

But the entity type "admin" does not exist anyway, so the check boils down to whether or not a user has made an export on that day. This means that once a day a user can export any of the entity types in the `ExportCsvFile` job:
https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/app/jobs/regular/export_csv_file.rb

Including:
A full user list export (names, email addresses, admin status, etc)
Staff actions
etc

As a proof of concept I was able to download a full list of users on https://try.discourse.org
