Summary:
iam a big fan of fuzzing/bruteforcing after my last submission #288533 on http://data.alienvault.com, i decided to go further, after some bruteforcing i came across this directory which looked kinda interesting for me http://data.alienvault.com/snort/
when u try to access the directory you will get 403 error, but if u try to go to http://data.alienvault.com/snort/index.php it will ask you for login details.

at this moment i remembered a writeup by @ITSecurityguard ( link at the end of report) he found a public .htpasswd file,cracked it and gained access to companyâ€™s development / beta environments. when i tried to browse http://data.alienvault.com/snort/.htpasswd i was shocked that the file got downloaded, it's content was:

YYYYYY:XXXXXXX

i thought that this was a plain text pw so i tried it but no luck, so i ran dirsearch again to find more hidden files on http://data.alienvault.com/snort/ and it found me these:
http://data.alienvault.com/snort/.htaccess
http://data.alienvault.com/snort/.claves

.htaccess:
' ' '
AuthName "Solo usuarios autorizados"
AuthType Basic
require valid-user
AuthUserFile /var/www/snort/.claves

' ' '
seems it's checking user input against the cerds located in /var/www/snort/.claves .

.claves:

' ' '
YYYYYYY:/XXXXXXXXX
' ' '
the moment i saw these i realized that these are not plain text passwords after some research i found that these are descrypt, DES(Unix) hashes, so as @ITSecurityguard did i used "john" to crack the hashes.
it got cracked in less than 1 sec (guess it wasn't secure?)

and the output was :

?:XXXXXX
?:XXXXXX

for both of the passwords, i ended up with (XXXXX:XXXXXX) as a name and a password,tried it to access http://data.alienvault.com/snort/index.php and it worked.
even though i found nothing sensitive (until this moment) on /snort/, i decided to report my find because there's a high possibility you're using the same name and pw in other basic Auth end points.

i will continue searching for other endpoints using Basic Authentication, i will keep you updated if i found anything intersting
