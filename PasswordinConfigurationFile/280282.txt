Summary:

Hi Team, 

Actual results:

There is no password complexity set for Master password in about:preferences#security , Because I was able to set my password like 123,123456,www, admin etc which is really common, apart from that we can use spaces as well in master password i was able to set space as my master password :/ 

Expected results:
Recommendation - Provide robust rules including upper lower letters, special characters etc.
