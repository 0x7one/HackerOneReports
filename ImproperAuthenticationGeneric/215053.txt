Summary:
Devices that can be monitored by airControl include a ticket based authentication system that allows access to the WebUI using a ticket id. This system had a flaw that allowed unauthenticated access without a valid ticket, given these requirements were met:
1. A device was monitored by airControl.
2. The "Open Web-UI" airControl feature was used on the device since last reboot.
3. Device wasn't rebooted after #2.

The vulnerability was reported on 2017-03-21 and fixed in these versions:
* airOS v8.0.2, v7.2.5, v6.0.2, v5.6.15 (released 2017-03-28)
* airGateway v1.1.9 (released 2017-03-28)
* airFiber v3.7-rc3, v3.4.3, v3.2.3 (released 2017-04-07)

* airControl 2.0.2 and 2.1-beta7 include changes to the "Open Web-UI" function authentication routine that makes all prior device versions invulnerable even after the "Open Web-UI" feature is used.
