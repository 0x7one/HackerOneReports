Summary:

Hi , 
##Intro
when a normal user create an account using that link  : https://www.bookfresh.com/users/signup/
he will have a freebie account (limited account / free )  . if the user want to get more Features he must upgrade to  Team($39.95/Month) or Business($19.95/Month) account .

but there is a bug that allow the attacker to get Team or Business account without paying anything  .

## Steps 
 1 - goto https://www.bookfresh.com/users/signup/
 2 - after filling the form  intercept the    registration request   (POST request) , there is a paramcalled user[act_type_id]  set to be 1 (user[act_type_id]=1) . 
to get Business account change to 2  . user[act_type_id]=2
to get Team account change to 3   . user[act_type_id]=3
3- submit the request and you will be redirected auto to your dashboard(which is btw not good practice) . with  Team/Business  Privilege .
