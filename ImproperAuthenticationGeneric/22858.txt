Summary:

Old unused Password reset tokens are not expiring on phabricator after the issuance of a new reset link.
Explaination
Suppose at 09:00 o'clock I used password forgot password option and got a reset link on my email. Lets call it reset_1. But i didnot use it.
And at 09:04 o'clock  I used again the forgot password option and got a new reset_link,which is reset_2.
Now generally after the issuance of reset_2,the previous unused reset link should expire.But in case of phabricator its not happening.Both the reset links are remaining usable at the same time.
