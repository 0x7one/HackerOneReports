Summary:
Security researcher @saad_ahmed reported two Mapbox owned S3 buckets with `public-read` ACL. One of these, `mapbox-js`, was `public-read` by design, the other however was not and subsequently was switched to a `private` ACL. Thank you again @saad_ahmed, we appreciate you keeping Mapbox security in mind.
