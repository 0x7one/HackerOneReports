Summary:

Airship doesn't reject weak passwords for the initial account. It happily accepts the password `test` for a root user `test`. This isn't a vulnerability in the software itself, but it's still listed in [vulnerabilities we prevent](https://github.com/paragonie/airship-docs/blob/master/en-us/WHY.md#vulnerabilities-we-prevent):

> **Broken Authentication**
> Airship rejects weak passwords that hackers could easily guess.

Feel free to close this as informative, but I think it's still security related, so I'll report it here.
