Summary:
Due to a recent code change, the rate limiting of incorrect two factor codes was not being enforced properly, allowing an attacker to try more codes than they should have been allowed to.
Trello has a feature which allows the user to enable Two factor authentication to enhance the security.
But no Rate Limiting is present on second authentication, i.e. code sent to Registered Mobile Number.
Attacker can try as many attempts as he wants to bypass the 2 factor authentication.
So using Burp Suite Intruder attacker can easily get the code sent to Registered Mobile Number.

Vulnerable end-point: /1/authentication

Even websites such as Facebook/Yahoo/Google were vulnerable to such flaws few years back.

As per current scenario, there is no use of two factor authentication in Trello right now. So a proper Rate Limiting should be implemented which will not allow the attacker to bypass the 2 factor authentication.
