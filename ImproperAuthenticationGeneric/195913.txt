Summary:
account.mail.ru allows user to be authenticated by external mail password. If user is authenticated with external e-mail and e-mail's password via account.mail.ru interface, he can access some of the gaming sites without additional authentication, though these sites can use different account (password) for the same e-mail.

Currently this behavior is by design and is not believed to have any real security implications due to fact in existent threat model access to e-mail always leads to access to gaming account.
