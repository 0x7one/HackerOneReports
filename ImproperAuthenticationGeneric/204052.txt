Summary:
The researcher found weak password in the site `nutty.ubnt.com`, but the system does not differentiate between authenticated and non-authenticated users. The researcher was not able to provide a PoC that could expose any vulnerability, so the report was closed "Informative".
nutty.ubnt.com has a login link, when clicking on it the user is presented with a login form.  using 'admin' for both username and password results in valid session.

this account allow for the upload of arbitrary files.  I am checking to see if this will allow for further functionality (like a webshell)
