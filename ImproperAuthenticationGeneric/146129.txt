Summary:


Hello Instacart,

Firstly, I would like to remind you that I made this report by mail 2 days ago, Sat, 16-08-2016 before I got the invite here. 

Although a user is expected to input password before updating their personal information. This is not so anyway as I have found that one could actually update "Personal Information​"​ without filling the "Current Password" field.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login your instacart account.
2. Go to account or https://www.instacart.com/store/account
3. In the personal information, Click Change
4. Fill new information leaving "Current Password" blank
5. Click "Save Account Information"
6. The ​​"Personal Information" will be updated.

This is a flaw as I could update my Personal Information without password although there is a field to input the password,hence, Authentication Bypass.

I hope I get a response from you soon.

​Looking Forward,
Shuaib Oladigbolu
