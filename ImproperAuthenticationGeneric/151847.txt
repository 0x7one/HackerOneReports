Summary:

Basic authentication is enabled on file access requests
====================
Description
---------------------
Basic authentication is enabled on the server if we request for the direct URL of a file.  The issues of using Basic Authentication can be read here -> [OWASP: Basic Authentication](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Basic_Authentication). Though your threat model considers brute-forcing as an acceptable risk, it is also worth noting that use of basic authentication makes the brute-force attacks much easier and faster. 

Detailed Steps
---------------------
**Step 1:** Open the browser and request for the direct URL of a file. Eg: (http://nc.hostiso.cloud/remote.php/webdav/Photos/Squirrel.jpg)

**Step 2:** Enter the username and password and capture the request in a proxy tool.
**Step 3:** It can be observed that the header with Base64 encoded username password is being sent in the request to server.
