Summary:

From the page: **https://app.mavenlink.com/settings/email**
When I tried to update the email address, I noticed that the database field was allocating 255 characters there.And if the input was more than 255 character that field was truncating.
For example:
``` text
haxorsistz+axorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxoailrsistzhaxoaaaaaaaa@gmail.com
```
This is a **265** character address.Though as per  RFC the maximum length allowed for an email address is 255 characters.
But when I submitted that info,that was truncated and stored first 255 characters to the database.So the email address which was stored into database was:
```text
haxorsistz+axorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxorsistzhaxoailrsistzhaxoaaaaaaaa
```
Which is an invalid email address,without any @ and trailing domain name.

So,I suggest mavenlink to check the submitted character length and the validity of that email address before storing it to database to prevent further errors.
