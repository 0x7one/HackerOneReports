Summary:

The zomato.com web application is vulnerable to authentication bypassing and sensitive information disclosure.

The flaw exist in “Verify Email Address” link which is received in a mail after registration. Once the user enters Full Name, Email Address and Password during registration, he/she is either asked to enter a 4 digit code or directly verify email address by clicking the red button for successful account activation/creation.
The verify email address link doesn’t expire even after successful user registration/account activation which allows a malicious user to authenticate into the victim’s session without password. When an user clicks on verify email address link, he/she is directly authenticated without a need of password, thereby bypassing authentication. Also, the verify email address link consist of ‘fbcid’ parameter which is just Base64 encoded. It leaks sensitive data like unique user id, 4 digit code and email address of the user. All these three parameter are being passed in URL itself (GET request).The application is authenticating a user using these three parameter without a need of a password. 

The verify email address GET URL consisting of sensitive data like unique user id, 4 digit code and email address gets stored in cache, browser history, web server logs. If the victim has accessed this link or activated his account from a public computer/cyber cafe, any user with malicious intent can access and misuse this url in order to authenticate into the victim session without a need of a password.
