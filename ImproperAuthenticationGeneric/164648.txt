Summary:
A security researcher discovered that after resetting a password, the user was automatically logged in. As such, compromising a legitimate password reset link (via referrer token leakage or a similar issue) could lead to compromising the account since the user would not be forced to log in after resetting their password. OWASP [forgot password recommendations](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Forgot_Password_Cheat_Sheet) suggest a better approach, which we have now implemented. Thanks to @attacker911 for another great report!
