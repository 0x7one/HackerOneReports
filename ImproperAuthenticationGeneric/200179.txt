Summary:
When verifying your phone number attached to your Uber account, it was possible to re-use an old verification URL to validate a new cell phone number. In addition to this, there was no rate limiting on the SMS verification which allowed for it to be easily brute-forced. The internal team resolved this by removing the ability to perform SMS URL verification in favor of a standard 4-digit verification.

Thanks, @hanuman1!
