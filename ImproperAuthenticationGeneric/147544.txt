Summary:

We can generate a __token__ test in any community that we are to use the API in the community (__although we are not community managers__)

In the attached __video__, I show you how to generate a token in a community in which I am not administrator and I can check absolutely everything and even make use of the API.

__Note__: talk to the administrator of the community to make this test getbootstrap.
