Summary:

Hi Team,

when i try to login in this subdomain(https://boozt-stage1.booztx.com/login) using gmail or facebook,the login form does not redirect me to gmail/facebook,it is giving the error message since it is blacklisted by the server.

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Goto https://boozt-stage1.booztx.com/login
2) Click login  using gmail or Facebook 
3) you will get error message as per the screenshot

Mitigation:

Whitelist those two URL"s since it is required by the user to signup.
