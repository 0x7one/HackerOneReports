Summary:

Hi,
This is a logical flaw in the application which may allow any arbitrary user to obtain account access of another user.
Below is the exploit scenario which may lead to potential account takeover in certain circumstances:
* User changes email while he is logged in his own account (Some wrong email)
* User enters an incorrect mail
* Another user (user-2) receives the verification link
* User- 2 clicks on the link (as of yet the new email doesn't get assoc. with the account)
* Now, User-2 clicks on forgot password - the reset link is sent on the User-2 's email address.
* User-2 clicks on that link, and changes the password.

Successfully gains any hackerone's account.

The glitch - User-1 needs to set wrong email by-mistake.

Possible Fix: 
> Authentication after the reset link is sent via the old creds.
> Use Codes which can be sent to emails and not Links for verification
