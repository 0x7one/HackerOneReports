Summary:

Hi guys,

Well, the issue is in authentication process, an attacker able to enumerate registered users on the site via brute forcing the login page, in case when ***user is not exist***, system returns the following error message: "User not exist", in case when ***user exist***, but incorrect password: "Password does not match".

Mitigation: handle the above situation correctly, e.g.: "Login failed. Invalid user ID or password". This doesn't inform the attacker on which credential is wrong and make enumeration more difficult

Thanks
