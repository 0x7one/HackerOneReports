Severity:
State:Closed

Summary:

**Host**
api.romit.io

**Endpoint**
/v0/cash/auth/login/verify

**Issue**
The GA Code is not verified on the server side for the users whose "Verification application" has been DENIED by the Romit support Team

**PoC**

1.    Setup an account at app.romit.io, use your apiKey, apiSecret and Location-ID to setup.
2.   Now click on Send Money, add the Phone Number and PIN of an account whose verification application has been denied once.
3.   You are prompted for GA code, enter any code. The server reponds with the following message `
{
  "success" : true,
  "error" : null,
  "response" : {
    "kioskEnrollmentStatusType" : "DENIED"
  }
}`
and prompted with this message on the UI [see image resubmit.png]
4. You are prompted to take an image of your ID and your image.
5. These documents are then saved on the server side.

Thanks
