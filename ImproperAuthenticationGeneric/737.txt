State:Closed

Summary:

When a request with an invalid authenticity_token is received, the user is logged out (tested for updating user's profile, which is available here: https://hackerone.com/diekatze/profile/edit) and the user receives a new session cookie, which is not authenticated at this point. However, the authenticated session cookie used by a user before logging out is still active.
