Summary:

##Description of the issue :-

I have found that when changing password  in passit account there is no Authentication process by asking current password or any other confirmation 

If a user leaves their computer  or account is still active in insecure place,or if account is hijacked or if CSRF is exploitable[bypassed]  we don't want someone else to be able to quickly change password. 

I somewhat understand the existing password is required to prevent malicious users (who may access the current session on the user's machine) from changing password.

## Impact

Since user can't recover his password ,  so if  someone changes his password victim may not get his account back
