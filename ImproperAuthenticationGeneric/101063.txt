Summary:

Riders are able to change their profile picture whenever they want and they should be allowed to either way.

When a rider becomes a driver they should not be able to change their profile picture due to the fact they can change their pictures to something inappropriate.

Replicate:
Login into the Uber Rider app with your driver information (which should be the same as rider either way)
Go to Settings
Edit Account (Put in password)
Change Photo - Press Save
             An error will occur saying "Failed to update account details" but the new picture will be applied
