Summary:
This bug allowed the creation of account for an unclaimed e-mail address. 
hi Team i was able to make an authentication bypass in your application .

Steps to replicate:

there are two phase evolved 
1) creating account using valid otp sent to registered email id .
2) capture the response it will be like 

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Cache-Control: no-cache
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Date: Tue, 21 Jul 2015 13:52:27 GMT
Server: Google Frontend
Set-Cookie: session="eyJTVEFSVCI6Ik9LIiwiQ09ERSI6dHJ1ZSwiRU1BSUwiOiJhYWFydW5hZ2Fyd2FsQGdtYWlsLmNvbSIsIk1PREUiOiJTRVQifQ\075\075|1437486747|1a8ca2ba59d77ea84586c163405f547b686d6a2f"; Path=/; secure; HttpOnly
Alternate-Protocol: 443:quic,p=1
Expires: Tue, 21 Jul 2015 13:52:27 GMT
Content-Length: 39

{"status": "OK", "url": "/secretpage/"}


Now attacker chance phase two:

1) Create an account with valid information 
2) Now some OTP will be sent to your registered email address 
3) now provide any random 4 digit number 
4)now edit the response for the specific request to 
{"status": "OK", "url": "/secretpage/"}
and add set cookie header value to any random number  of same length
5) OTP will be bypassed PFA Screen shot.

Let me know if you need more details.

Thanks
