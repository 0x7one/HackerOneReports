Summary:

INTRODUCTION
------------------------
During the testing of http://www.booztlet.com/ I have noticed that the account related links available from https://www.boozt.com/ are also available in http://www.booztlet.com/. This should not be the case, as this shop doesn't have a "My account" section.

ATTACK
-------------
1. The attacker creates a new account in http://www.booztlet.com/ by using the link https://www.booztlet.com/se/sv/customer/create 
2. The attacker creates a page with the contents from playground.html and uploads it somewhere
3. The target recieved the playground.html link. Here he will be automatically logged in the http://www.booztlet.com/ in the attacker's account and then redirected to the start page. Both steps can be done, because the "OK" answer recieved after login from http://www.booztlet.com/ will be as attachement in plain text and the victim is not redirected somewhere else, thus allowing the attacker to execute a second step.
4. The victim has no idea he is logged in another account and makes a purchase.
5. From this point on I couldn't test forward because that would involve in actually making a real order.

WHY IS THIS EXPLOITABLE
-----------------
So, as mentioned in step 5, I couldn't test it forward and I am assuming here. After the victim makes the order, the attacked has access to the real order from "my orders" link (https://www.booztlet.com/se/sv/customer/orders). From here he may see a lot of sensitive information, such as payment method, address and so on. He could, maybe, contact support to change the delivery address as he has access to all the real data. The attacked can also probably see the telephone number (and call the victim pretending to be an admin from the shop) or maybe even access parts of the payment method (probably nothing real sensitive).

HOW TO FIX IT
-----------------
Disable the login and register process as clearly this is not intended for https://www.booztlet.com.
