Summary:

Hello,

when we include a link on statement in our profile, it just create an html tag like this:
``` <a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a> ```
^ That's vulnerable. How? Once the owner of the profile added a malicious url it is possible that the link has a referral link thingy that will open a tab that has a phishping page of  gratipay.

Fix:
``` <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow">http://google.com</a> ```
