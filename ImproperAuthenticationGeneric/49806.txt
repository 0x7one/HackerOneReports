Summary:

Hi Twitter !!

I just wanted to report a major flaw which I found in https://ads.twitter.com , hoping it make twitter more secure and I am glad for being a part of it.

**Vulnerability Name**:  OWASP:A6 Sensitive data Exposure

**Vulnerable URL**: https://ads.twitter.com/admin/accounts_typeahead.json?query=*****

**Vulnerability Overview**: Information Disclosure without any *authentication* .

**Proof of Concept:**
   - Log into twitter account first.
   - Go to this URL https://ads.twitter.com/admin/accounts_typeahead.json?query=avicoder
   - Change the query string to any other account or screen_name ex: *microsoft*
   - You can view all the information about the account associated with the  campaign.
   - Usually this information is only visible to members of campaign.
   - Look at user_name_info element in JSON POC which actually exposing the members associated with campaign. 

**I attached the json file when I query my account in private window..
Its gives me all information about members linked to the campaign without any need of being (admin,manager,analyst)**

I made this report short  unlike my previous reports but it is to the point.
Please revert back if more information is needed. 

*Happy to help*
