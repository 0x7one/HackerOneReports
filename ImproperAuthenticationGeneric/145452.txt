Summary:

Hi,

I found a bug where a shared link of particular file can disclose all files of that folder. 

###Steps to reproduce

+ Make a group( ```http://*/nextcloud/index.php/settings/users```) and a standard user in it.
+ Now goto any folder and change it to gallery view
{F99993}

+ Invite that group which u made in step 1 with ``share`` privilege .
+ From standard user account, goto that shared folder and make a shared link of any file. E.g:

{F99992}

+ Untick the ``can share`` privilege from that group using folder owner account. Eg: 

{F99994}




Now the shared link which was created by standard user will work as folder shared link. And when folder untick the ``can share`` privilege public is automatically created without asking folder owner.

Thanks
