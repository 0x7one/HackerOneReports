Summary:

Hello Team,
I Noticed a Critical Flow that allows attacker to Delete Any *Airbnb* users Symbol!

ex: **[https://create.airbnb.com/16925230/symbol/delete](https://create.airbnb.com/16925230/symbol/delete)**
* Just Copy The link and replace victim's profile id with `16925230`.
* Run the URL.
* Victims Symbol will be deleted!

Looking Forward!
