WeaknessName:Improper Authentication - Generic

Summary:
A user of the POS app or any other Shopify mobile application could use their api access token to make requests to a specific API endpoint, which would have allowed them to change the "shop" object in a way that bypasses Shopify's permission model. We fixed the issue by adding restrictions to this endpoint, ensuring that only the application owner can make requests, even through the API.
Hi

in settings -> account owner can set login service for staff members!
this is only available for owners, and full access admins can't see or change this values!

admin with setting access can send a "POST" request to shop.json and change this settings!


steps:

- get access token for one full access admin (you can send request to xauth or sniff it from mobile device)
- send request with POST method to "https://~ShopName~.myshopify.com/admin/shop.json"

data:

{"shop":{"google_apps_domain":"anydomain","google_apps_login_enabled":true}}

google_apps_login_enabled
google_apps_domain


so any admin just with setting access can modify this option,this must limited to owner!
