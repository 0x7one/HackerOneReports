Hi Team,

Description : Project Manager(Full access) Can't access the projects and invoices which are not assigned to him.But this can be bypassed and following action Can be done by Any project manager : 
1. Mark as send 
2.Mark as draft

4.Mark as open 
Any manager Can change above mentioned settings of any Invoices of the company.

Steps to reproduce : 
1. Create a Account with Admin and Add a project manager with Full access. Assign him Some project. Add some more projects and invoices but don't assign these to the project manager.
2.Now login from Project manager's account you will see that you won't have access to all the invoices . You can only create the invoices based on your assigned projects.
3.Open a Invoice and you will see more action section in the invoice. Here you will have multiple options like Mark as sent,Mark as closed,Mark as draft etc. All these requests will have different HTTP requests .
