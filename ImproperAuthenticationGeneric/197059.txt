Summary:

Hello - 

A user with restricted access is able to view the phone number and the billing email of the account owner by simply ".json" at the end of the "https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/" URL. The URL structure looks like this:

https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/██████.json

Wherin "███████" is the account ID of the owner. 

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Owner creates a New Relic account, invites User2 as a restricted user to join the account. 
2. User2 creates an account and is added to the team
3. User2 appends ".json" at the end of the URL and is able to see the admin information

Please let me know if you need additional information, thanks.
