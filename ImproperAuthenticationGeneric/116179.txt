Summary of Findings
-------------------------------

The remote server (https://download.newrelic.com) allowed unauthenticated access to special access files that are only intended to be accessible after contacting the New Relic program managers as seen below.

Exploiting the Vulnerability/Mis-configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------------

By performing search engine analysis, I was able to identify the name of a child directory `/eclipse-established` which appears to contain various source files related to special access/beta program application testing as seen below:

Concluding Remarks/Remediation Advice
------------------------------------------------------------

Obviously there is a slight possibility that this was the intended function and that there was not supposed to be any type of access control over these directories - The reason that I may have identified this as a false positive is due to the fact that when a user tries to access the `/android_agent` directory they are provided with the instructions to contact support.

If this *is* the case and it is a mis-configuration, one option would be to enforce http basic authentication with something similar to the below example: 

    server {
       listen 80;
       server_name www.example.com example.com;
       root /var/www/www.example.com/web;
    [...]
       location /eclipse-established {
    auth_basic "Restricted";
    auth_basic_user_file /var/www/www.example.com/.htpasswd;
       }
    [...]
    }
