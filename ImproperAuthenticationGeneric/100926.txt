Summary:
On November 21 2015, @nahamsec reported two Yelp IP addresses that were exposing Uchiwa dashboards on port 8080. In that dashboard, he was also able to find a hardcoded password on a Sensu check that gave him access to a RabbitMQ server running on the same machine. The immediate issue was fixed quickly by updating firewall rules. Additionally, we did a full internal audit of all systems that touched the affected hosts.
