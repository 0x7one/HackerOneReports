Summary:
The Facebook OAuth application was misconfigured to allow any URL that followed the `https://auth.uber.com/login?*` format to be provided as a `redirect_uri`. By taking advantage of this, @ngalog was able to discover that the `next_url` parameter could be added to the `redirect_uri` allowing it to be chained further. Next, @ngalog found that the `https://login.uber.com/logout` endpoint would redirect based on the Referer header, making it possible to chain together another redirect. By piecing this together, @ngalog was able to provide us with an awesome single-URL PoC which would:

1. Prompt OAuth authorization on `facebook.com`
2. Redirect to `https://auth.uber.com/login?next_url=https://login.uber.com/logout` from Facebook
3. Redirect to `https://login.uber.com/logout` from `auth.uber.com`
4. Redirect to attacker site from Referer header and return the token

When combined, this would have allowed for a full account takeover and was a very creative and cool bug.

Nice work, @ngalog!
