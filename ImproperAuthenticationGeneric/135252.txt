Summary:
##Issue

The reporter found a design flaw in a feature where pdf-reports are generated. Pdf-reports were generated using 19-digit random names and the names as well as the reports were persistent and accessible by all authenticated users. 

##Fix

Guessing a random 19-digit name was found to be almost impossible, but still posing a minor risk. To further minimize the risk probablility of customer information disclosure, a 2-minute life span was added to the pdf-reports.

##Reasoning

The report was found to be valid and once verified the fix was very easy. Although not perfect, the fix mitigates the risk probability to near zero.
