Summary:
In this report, the researcher found that it was possible to bypass our CAPTCHA check by injecting a random value into the X-Forwarded-For header in the sign in POST request. At the time the researcher submitted this report, we only enforced CAPTCHA checks on sign-in requests that had failed multiple times in an effort to stop brute-force login attacks. By modifying the X-Forwarded-For header, the researcher discovered that our server would interpret each request as a new user and so it wouldn't force a CAPTCHA check.

After we solved this bug by changing how our servers handled the X-Forwarded-For header, we ended up changing our CAPTCHA system entirely. Now, we use an invisible CAPTCHA that is always active, even on the first login, making for a more secure environment for our users.
