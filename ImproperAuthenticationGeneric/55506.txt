Summary:

Hello Twitter Security Team, 

###Problem:
Here is a privacy issue that break your privacy for protected tweets.

###Details:
I have two accounts on twitter @dia2diab and @Dia2diabTest , from the first one i changed the settings of Tweet privacy to be "Protect my Tweets" and now if you access one of my tweets like this one here twitter.com/dia2diab/status/585987812643708928 Or here mobile.twitter.com/dia2diab/status/585987812643708928 from a private window you will find that "@dia2diab's Tweets are protected.". great !!

Now, i don't wanna @Dia2diabTest to see anything from my tweets, so i decided to block him, i think now this user can't see my tweets by anyway [i blocked him & i made my tweets private].

The amazing thing when i access this url mobile.twitter.com/dia2diab/status/585987812643708928 with my logged in session with the second user i found that i can see the tweet.

This is break your privacy rules there support.twitter.com/articles/14016

###Fixing:
You must need to protect your users privacy.
