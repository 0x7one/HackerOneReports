Summary:

Hello, this report is a copy of my previous reports sent to your email ( security@wepay.com) some days ago. ( Ticket #437198 and Ticket #437190 ):

You mentioned that you are working on a "sudo mode" for adding an email address, deleting an account and other sensitive actions (add bank accounts for payouts, etc.);. Sensitive information like those should have re authentication in place.

Thank you.
