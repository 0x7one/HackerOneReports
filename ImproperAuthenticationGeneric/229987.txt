Summary:


Hi team,

I noticed that when requesting multiple reset links at https://demo.weblate.org/ all tokens are valid and can be used.

In numerous applications the following policy is adopted as an additional security measure:

- keep valid only that token with shorter lifetime (last requested)

or

- invalidate all reset links generated after successful use of one of these tokens

Please check it.
