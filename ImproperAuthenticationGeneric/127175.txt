Summary:
Our e-mail provider at the time had problems where some e-mails would not be sent out over TLS. Based on data from [Google Postmaster Tools](https://postmaster.google.com/), we were seeing as high as 12% of our e-mail from our provider to Google mail servers not encrypted. We opened a case with them on March 31st, 2016, about this issue, as this was something we couldn't directly control or fix.

Based on this issue and some other issues we were having, we made the decision to migrate to a new e-mail provider for our e-mail. Since migrating in April 2016, we haven't seen any problems at all with sending our production e-mail over TLS to other mail servers, with 99.9%+ of our e-mail to Google's mail servers encrypted.

On May 17th, 2016, we received notification that the old provider has corrected the issue, though there are no current plans to migrate back.
