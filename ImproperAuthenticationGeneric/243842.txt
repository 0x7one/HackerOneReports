Summary:

Hi,

This is a bypass of the fix on #229987. I could confirm that old link still works. Though you would need to use 2 browsers to pull this off

##Reproduction Steps
1. In Browser1, request a password reset
- Load link sent to your email in the same browser 
- Request another password reset in Browser2
- Load link sent to your email in the same browser 
- Change the password on Browser2
- Successful :D
- Change the password on Browser1
- Success :D
- Now login in any of the password with the last password.

Shuaib.
