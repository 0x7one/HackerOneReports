Summary:

I took at "vimeo" cookie ("Vimeo authentication token" https://vimeo.com/cookie_list)

And to show approximately my thought process I did :
1. compare two generate values from two different sessions of mine

epk9rrdskc70pcdxxmrdmdx7jpcdxxmrdmdx7%2Cpv222v2mfw90w5dcv5wtkmsfffxfsxc2tdruxmcrt
epk9rrdskc70pcdxxttcrmc7jpcdxxttcrmc7%2C5jjylb%2C_fqq%2C_%2Cf85wpDanqvnh7%2Cpvds5tt9ds9trcvv2mdsf25tx02kc5kkuw9mcf2cs

both started with "epk9rrdskc70pcdxx" 

2. I have Googled part of this common string and found http://www.integernumber.com/305334256 
It had "epk9rd" as 305334256 in base 29

3. I have played a little and saw that I can create similar strings, but not quite the one as in the cookie value

4. So I decided to take the entire string (separated by ".") and make a python script that tries if it can transform from any base (2,3,4,5,6 .100) to base 10 

def to(s, b):
    """
    Converts given number s, from base b to base 10

    s -- string representation of number
    b -- base of given number
    """
    assert(1 < b < 37)
    return int(s, b)

for i in range(2,200):
        try:
                print to("pv222v2mfw90w5dcv5wtkmsfffxfsxc2tdruxmcrt",i),i
        except:
                pass

(the script tries to change base, if not tries the next value)

5. Results: for two different values of "vimeo" cookie, I got this: (value,base)

6. So the "vimeo" cookie can be considered encoded in base 34,35 or 36 and the decoded value is similar to other values from my other sessions

7. This means that the cookie value can be guessed and an attack can go like this:

Attacker generates for months cookie values (1 per second I don't think triggers any firewall for example) and finally gets to some account. (the other substring of the vimeo cookie is generated the same)
