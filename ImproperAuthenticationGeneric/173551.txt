Summary:
With an email address for a valid Uber account, it was possible to take over that account because the reset token was exposed in the response of a password reset HTTP request. This meant an attacker could initiate password reset for an account and immediately receive the reset token for that account.

We consider the security of our user's data top priority, so we were very interested in this report. Furthermore, @procode701 was a pleasure to work with and we look forward to more reports in the future.
