Hi Team

**Description:** 
During the analysis, It was found that the `█████████████████████` ask's for credentials from the users to access the ██████, But the weak credentials set `█████:██████` allows anyone to login.

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Open █████████████████████████
  1. Enter `█████████` ███████ username and password field.
  1. You now have access to the analytical data. 

## POC
███

## Remediation
Use strong set of password instead of common████generic ones like `████:██████`

## Impact

An attacker can bypass the authentication check and access the internal analytical data.

PS: apart from the analytical data, I wasn't able to find much.
