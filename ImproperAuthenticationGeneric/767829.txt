2. for example user successfully created the account with ```abc@xyz.com``` and password ```12345678```
3. Now attacker will create the account with the email used in step 2  ```abc@xyz.com``` with different password.
4. After completion of step 3 the password for the  ```abc@xyz.com``` user will be set to the password used by attacker.
5. This will result in the account take over by attacker.
