Summary:

Hi Team,
Its a minor issue, but hope you'll fix it.
It seems like after changing password for example my current password is : Dashi2367@
And lets assume that the hacker got an access to my account, and i will change my password to ex. Dashi2367/ . 

There's no restriction when i change a new password with a similarity to the old password 
In this way the attacker can still hack account easily because there's a similarity to the old and the new one.

Hope you'll triaged this.
Looking forward to your reply.

Best Regards,
Husnain Iqbal
