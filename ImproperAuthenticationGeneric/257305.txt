Summary:

##Description
I have found a flaw in the authentication process when accessing the website by visiting an unsubscribe link.

##PoC
1. Visit http://click.email.boozt.com/?qs=723df61c937e4dbf9e378d2157f7907baa95fa00699f2b4d13e192b1d14ed67323d5c7a75c6f801baf1e68c2beabbc43d574caeb9b6f8c085971631d636b3cda
2. Go in my customer profile and click on **My orders**.  Server should respond a 403 and ask for a password. F210300
3. Now, resend the request, but intercept it and change your PHPSESSID cookie. Server now return a 200 and you are fully authenticated. F210301

##Impact
This vulnerability allows an attacker to access victim private info and orders. I think the impact is high because the unsub link is present in promotion emails, which is more likely to be shared with other users.
