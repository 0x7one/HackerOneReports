Hello,

My self Abdulwahab,
 I want to Alert You that Your website is Facing a serious Problem Called : Username Enumeration
This Problem is on
nextcloud.com/wp-admin

We Use wpscan to get username 

and the username is 
"frank"
After getting username a user can Bruteforce it Using Wpscan and get access to admin panel and upload shell and also get all sub_domain Means Full Server is Hacked!
