Summary:
KIWI had been trialing the use of FreshDesk internally, and had left a DNS entry pointed to their services which subsequently was out of control of KIWI. This could have been used to confuse or trick KIWI customers.
hi,

one of your subdomain is pointing to FRESHDESK but servicce is expire there,
so i can claim this http://service.kiwi.ki/  subdomain.

Fix: remove dns entry of  this subdomain asap




Thanks
