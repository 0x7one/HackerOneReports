Summary:

**Summary**:

Legal Robot's s3 bucket [**legalrobot.com**] is misconfigured. The ACL allows me to _access_ and _copy_ **all files**. This means that I could go through and copy all the media files on the s3 bucket.  I did not attempt to _delete_ any files as I did not want to go too far and affect your operations.

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1) Generate a random AWS key from the AWS Console
2) Perform the following proof-of-concept:
```
$ aws s3 ls s3://legalrobot

copy: aws s3 cp s3://legalrobot/video/meeting-room/MP4/Meeting-Room.mp4

I've noticed that this particular video file is being played in the background of your homepage. 

**Remediation**:

Update your ACL to the proper configuration, preventing other users' from potentially modifying or accessing your s3 bucket.
