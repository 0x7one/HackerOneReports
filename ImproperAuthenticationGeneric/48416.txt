Summary:

Hackerone's destroys user sessions automatically after signing out,changing password etc.So Old sessions are seems to be worthless for any attacker.But I found something,by exploiting this you can restrict any hackerone user to logging into his account.

**Pre-Requisition**
I just need one of his old sessions.

**steps to reproduce**
1. Login to hackerone.
2. Capture any request.
3. Send it to burp intruder.
4. Logout from hackerone.
5. Now start intruding that captured request,which is carrying the old destroyed session.
6. Try log in from other device.
7. Every time burp intruder sends a request,the present logged in account will be logged out automatically.
So if you keep continue intruding,that user will never be able to login to his own ID.
