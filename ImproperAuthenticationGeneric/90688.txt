Summary:

Hi 

as you mentioned in #56726 

    "Only the the store owner is allowed to create new staff members"

admins can't create new staff members!
but with this vulnerability admins can use api to create user! 


steps:

- get access token for one full access admin (you can send request to xauth or sniff it from mobile device)

- send request with POST method to "https://~ShopName~.myshopify.com/admin/users.json"

data : 

{
"user": {
"email": "anyvalidmail@valid.com",
"first_name":"~fname~",
"last_name" : "~lname~",
"pin" : 1234
}
}


now, a user will be created! this user marked as POS staff member, without any access to admin shop!

-  go to "https://~ShopName~.myshopify.com/admin/auth/recover"

- enter new admin email address

- follow instructions to reset password
after recovering password user will convert to normal limited access

- open that first full access admin and then select new created admin

- unselect limited access

Done, a new admin will full access created!


Regards
