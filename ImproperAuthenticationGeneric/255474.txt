Summary:

Hello
I recently found a bug that without entering First and Last name the profile got updated, means a user can able to put his/her full name blank. In your website there is a validation for first and last name. If a user fill the first name then he has to fill the last name too and vice-versa but if he put both the field blank then he can update his profile and put his full name blank.
POC is attached with this report.
Thank you
Regards
