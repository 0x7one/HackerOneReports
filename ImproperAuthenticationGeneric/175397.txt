## Summary:

Hey!

I want to inform you about sub domain takeover issue i.e. when I did your DNS enumeration i came across :-

Ip Address        Target Name
----------        -----------
151.101.9.7       www.brave.com
151.101.9.7       prod.p.ssl.global.fastly.net
151.101.9.7       prod.p.ssl.global.fastlylb.net

Except the first domain name , the rest two CName point to an unclaimed domain on fastly.com(CDN) that when opened show :-

Fastly error: unknown domain: prod.p.ssl.global.fastly.net. Please check that this domain has been added to a service

the above error indicates that the above address is not in use and can be claimed by an attacker by making an account on fastly.com . 



## Products affected: 

 *  Brave's sub domain 

## Steps To Reproduce:

 * Steps:- Open the above CName ( prod.p.ssl.global.fastly.net.) , as the error is thrown , it indicates the above address can be claimed by creating an account on fastly and giving this as the Cname for your own domain.
