Summary:

Hi,
I found a Brute forcing attacking on your website.

A common threat web developers face is a password-guessing attack known as a brute force attack. A brute-force attack is an attempt to discover a password by systematically trying every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until you discover the one correct combination that works. 

This login page doesn't have any protection against password-guessing attacks (brute force attacks). It's recommended to implement some type of account lockout after a defined number of incorrect password attempts. Consult Web references for more information about fixing this problem.

I am tested 10 invalid credentials and no account lockout was detected.This means it's vuln to Brute forcing attack.
