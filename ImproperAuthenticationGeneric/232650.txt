Summary:

The tested application is Starbucks Turkey Android App. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.starbucks.tr&hl=en 

All these things are made without any login. I did not login the app.
1. I tried to intercept traffic between starbucks app and server with burp suite. I could not be successful because of the ssl pinning. 
2. Before the unpinnig ssl, I look around the app's all screens.
3. When i look at the messages tab i saw a proccess on my burp history. 
4. Application sent a request to https://crmproxy.protel.com.tr/api/v1/MobileInbox/Limit/20 this url and it took a response.
5. I evaluated this request then i saw the Authorization: Basic QVBSTlhXTFpUUTo4NGY0NDlmMWYzOWEyMDUz token.
6. I tried to reach this url via browser however, i couldnt because it wants to basic authentication and i tried the default password which comes to mind but i couldnt be successful. 
7. I remembered when there was a request on burp which has Authorization: Basic QVBSTlhXTFpUUTo4NGY0NDlmMWYzOWEyMDUz token and i tried to add this token in my all request while trying to access via browser.
8. Bingoooo! It worked! I reach the https://crmproxy.protel.com.tr this api server and i looked around it then i found the api docs.
9. Finally, i tried to sent all request in api docs, i was successful in all of them. 

I added to all screenshots below. If there is any question, i may answer them.

Thank you,
