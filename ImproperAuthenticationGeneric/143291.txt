Summary:

issue:
1.click forget password as driver or rider [https://login.uber.com/login]
2.input an email which not signed up! 
3. press reset password. 
there will be 'We've sent you an email with a link to reset your password.' message. 

because it can not verify email is signed up or not! 

I'd tried with my personal email. I got the message in webpage but did not get any further email from Uber. 
is that another bug?
