Summary:

Hi Team,

Description : Project Manager(Full access ) With Access to limited projects also have limited access to Invoices. So Project manager is assigned to limited project by Admin and he have access to limited Invoices related to assigned project. But Project manager can Actually Record payment of any invoice in the company.The HTTP request of Recording payment is Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation where server doesn't check whether Project manager have access to corresponding Invoice or not.

Vulnerable HTTP request : 

POST /invoices/[Invoice_ID]/payments HTTP/1.1
Host: vijaygangani.harvestapp.com

Steps to reproduce : 
1.Create a Invoice by project manager account and record the payment for that Invoice.
2.The HTTP request of recording payment would look something like the above mentioned request.
3.Change the Invoice ID in the Request to any other Invoice ID which the project manager doesn't have access to and send the request tot the server.
4.You will see that the Payment will be recorded for your mentioned Invoice ID.


Let me know if you need any further assistance or Video POC to understand the issue.

Best Regards !
