Summary:

Hi,

Hope you are good!

Steps to repro:
1) Create a HackerOne account having email address "a@x.com".
2) Now Logout and ask for password reset link. Don't use the password reset link.
3) Login using the same password back and update your email address to "b@x.com" and verify the same.
4) Now logout and use the password reset link which was mailed to "a@x.com" in step 2.
5) Password will be changed.

All previous password reset links should automatically expire once a user changes his email address.
Please let me know if this can be fixed.

Best Regards
Anand Prakash
