Summary:
##Issue

The reporter found a way to circumvent the privilege system for the admin-user for a company account. Once circumvented, a user could gain access to critical information in the company account, including user data. The finding requires the use of TUPAS-authentication as an entry point which made exploitability harder. 

##Fix

No final fix yet. Process-level controls added.

##Reasoning

The implementation as such was based on a business decision which included proper risk assessment. Initially this report was dismissed based on the existing risk assessment. The reporter however showed exemplary persistence and did a very thorough rebuttal of the bug bounty team's conclusions and decisions. The issue was then escalated within LähiTapiola with the specific angle of privacy and potential information leak of privacy sensitive data. The original business decision was re-evaluated and it was found to be out of line in light of the upcoming regulatory changes. The bounty reflects both criticality and exploitability.
