Summary:

When a user login with facebook 0Auth and then he removes the app from facebook app setting the session is not expiring.
Poc:-

Step1: Go to gratipay login page.
Step2: Click on login with facebook 0 auth and login with facebook.
Step3: Go to facebook then app setting.
Step4: Now remove the gratipay app from here and go back to gratipay site.
Step5: You will see that you are still logged in.

Hence session is not expiring so it is vulnerable.
