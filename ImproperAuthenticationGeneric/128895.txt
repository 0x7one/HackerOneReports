Summary:

I was just trying to login vault.uber.com

I entered email **xx** and password **xx**,  I got loggedin to someones account.
I entered email **zz** and password **zz**,  I got loggedin to someones account.

It means passowrd complexity and length of username/email is not enforced. This allowed my to access the someones account. Since it contains payment related information, password complexity and email should be there.
