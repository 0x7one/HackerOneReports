Summary:

Hi!

The OAUTH prompt at https://connect.squareup.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=EXAMPLE prints out the current OAUTH appname without sanitizing it from {{}}-style AngularJS templates. This makes it possible for an attacker to add an AngularJS template to his/her appname that calls the $scope.allow function (essentially emulating a click on the "Allow" button). When a user visits the authorization page at https://connect.squareup.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=EXAMPLE, the template injection will authorize the app without any user interaction.

Steps:
1. Sign up for square connect at https://connect.squareup.com
2. Create a new app, name it "{{allow()}}"
3. Sign in to another square account
4. Visit the apps OAUTH authorization URL at https://connect.squareup.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_APP_ID&redirect_uri=https://google.com
5. Your square account has now allowed the newly created app full permissions
