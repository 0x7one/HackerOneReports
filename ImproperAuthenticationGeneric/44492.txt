Summary:

Hey hi,

Steps to reproduce:
=============================================

I have been testing the twitter kit in fabric.
I added login with twitter integration to my application.
I pushed the application to my android phone , clicked login with twitter.
entered my username and password.

Searched my logcat for everything with the word "twitter" in it. 
I found the oauth token getting leaked via login with twitter integration on Fabric.
So any app that is using fabric's twitter kit ( login with twitter) is vulnerable to it.
Any other app installed on that particular phone hasaccess to logcat, and can read the logs.
which results in oauth token stealing.

karthik
