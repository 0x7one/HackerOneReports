Summary:

**Summary:**

The bucket `nasacso` which is used in your `augur-app` repo README is publicly write-able

**Description:**

Hi team - 

I noticed that in the `augur-app` readme, you pull an image from a bucket called `nasacso`:

{F434871}

This bucket allows for public upload:

{F434872}

If this bucket belongs to you, please restrict write-access to only authorized users.

If this bucket is NOT yours, an attacker is still able to replace the image you reference with a malicious one, which will be served up in your README. In which case, you should source your image from somewhere else.

Best regards,
@the_arch_angel

## Impact

If this bucket belongs to augur, then an attacker can exfiltrate data and upload malicious data.

If this bucket does not belong augur, then an attacker can replace the image file that the readme is referencing with a malicious file (obviously less severe, but still a minor risk).
