Summary:

Hi I've found that the user is allowed to perform brute force in help.nextcloud.com login, i've tried to input wrong password 25 times , then input my correct password in my 26th attempt and it is successfully login, a malicious minded user can always continue guessing an account password.

Steps to reproduce

Go to https://help.nextcloud.com/ then click login button and you can now perform brute force attack.
