Summary:

Hi,

Sir I found a Vulnuberlity in your Website. Called Session Management Flaw
You can Know More About This Flaw through OWASP Guide
 https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Broken_Authentication_and_Session_Management&setlang=en

in this Loop Hole The Application Is Not Destroying the Session After Signing Out from The User Account at
https://rpm.newrelic.com/
& Thus If The Attacker Got his Hands Upon Users Cookies he can Get Access To the User Account.

An attacker can get the user session cookies by any means Session Spoofer, Cookie Staler etc 

Steps To Reproduce:

1: Login to Your newrelic  Account. after successful login you will b taken to https://rpm.newrelic.com/

2: Then Use "BrupSuite" or any other  Utility to get the cookies of that session ( I'm using "EditThisCookie" Chrome Extension in a Case of Attacker he can Use Any Sort Of cookie Stealing Script or Cookies Soofing Utility to get his hands on cookies ).

>And grab the cookies of active User Session.

3: Then Logout of the  Account from https://rpm.newrelic.com/ & You will See That The Site will take you towards 
https://login.newrelic.com/

4: Clear all Cookies related to https://newrelic.com/ & https://rpm.newrelic.com/   Then Inject Hijacked User Cookies so that you can get into the user session...

After the cookies Is been injected You will See That the main page https://newrelic.com/  & https://login.newrelic.com/ are telling you that you are not logged in but if you open https://rpm.newrelic.com/ You will see that you are logged in to the account...

& You can see & Edit any User Info :P

& Also The cookies you captured will work for long so you can get into account anytime you need i tested cookies that worked lost last about 1 day :p 

Sir, I'm making & Uploading a POC Video to YouTube & Will send you as soon as possible.

thanks,
Khizer Javed
