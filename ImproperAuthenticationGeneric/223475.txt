Summary:

Hi team,

I noticed an authentication break when logging in with 3rd party credentials in https://hosted.weblate.org/

POC

1 access https://hosted.weblate.org/accounts/profile/#auth> link to a Google account (for example)
2 on other device access the same account using Google credentials
3 return to the device of step 1> remove the Google account at https://hosted.weblate.org/accounts/profile/#auth> disconnect

The session remains active on the device in step 2. So I continue with a valid session from credentials not linked to any account at https://hosted.weblate.org

Please check it.
