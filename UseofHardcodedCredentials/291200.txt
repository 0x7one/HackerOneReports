Summary:

I was using a tool called RegShot to take a snap shot of the registry before and after installation in order to see what changes were being made in the registry and I discovered hard-coded credentials

I have attached the full comparison details of the registry changes

but these are the lines and reg entries where the credentials are stored:

 HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\KasperskyLab\AVP17.0.0\environment\dump\User: "kavdumps"
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\KasperskyLab\AVP17.0.0\environment\dump\Password: "UxzAbKFLufVBSg8Y"
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\KasperskyLab\AVP17.0.0\environment\dump\FTP: "kavdumps.kaspersky.com"

I was able to open browser and navigate to ftp://kavdumps.kaspersky.com which gave me a login prompt.
I used the username: kavdumps 
and password of: UxzAbKFLufVBSg8Y

I was able to login. The directory was empty however

I have attached a video and the log file

I have seperated the lines so it is easier to find in the file.
