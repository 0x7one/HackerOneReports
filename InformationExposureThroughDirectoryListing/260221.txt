Summary:

Hello.

I found open directories on the site https://apps.nextcloud.com, which can be viewed by any unauthorized user. There is an error at https://apps.nextcloud.com/static/. F212856
All directories and files in them, starting with `/static/` can be viewed or downloaded with all the content. Perhaps there is some kind of confidential information. 

Decision:
Disable directory browsing.  If this is required, make sure the listed files does not induce risks.

Thank you
