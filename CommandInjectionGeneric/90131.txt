Summary:

Scenario: An attacker creates a name as =AND(2>1)  and creates a ticket. When a team member clicks export  as csv and opens it instead of seeing =AND(2>1)  they see TRUE. This means that the cell is active. An attacker could basically attack makes a ticket, use -2+3+cmd|' /C calc'!E1 and could execute malicious commands through CMD. 
E1 is the cell it's located in.

  This may cause a warning but the team member would  believe it's a trusted file  so you have high chance of execution.  
Best way to mitigate this vulnerability is if you append ' to the list of triggers, = , + , - Excel will ignore the ' and just show ='AND(2>1) instead
