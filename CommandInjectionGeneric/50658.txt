Summary:

Hi hackerone team,

I'm a friend of Peiying and am looking for a position at hackerone. While playing around with your product, I found a serious vulnerability in your application: it allows attackers to craft executables on the hackerone.com domain rather than the sandboxed one on S3.

1. attacker reports a bug titled `hackerone\"||calc||`
2. attacker can then direct victim to [https://hackerone.com/notifications.bat](https://hackerone.com/notifications.bat)
3. when downloaded and executed, it will open calculator on victim's windows environment

The potentials of this vector is outlined in [Reflected File Download: A New Web Attack Vector](https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/Reflected-File-Download---A-New-Web-Attack-Vector/), which does not limit to executing commands on victim's machines.

To fix, since hackerone is a Rails deployment, at the rendering step of the notifications action:

instead of:

`render json: notifications`

do:

    respond_to do |format|
        format.json do
            render json: notifications
        end
    end

so requests of non-json formats would return a 406 Not Acceptable. see [respond_to](http://apidock.com/rails/ActionController/MimeResponds/InstanceMethods/respond_to).

Look forward to hearing back from you soon,

Ricky
