Summary:

Hello New Relic Team ,

i have just found that i can add html code and it will be executed .
the issue in https://synthetics.newrelic.com
if you added a new monitor with the html code , for example [ "><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0DSbAs4.gif"> ]

when you go to [ https://synthetics.newrelic.com/accounts/"account_number"/synthetics ] 
and search for it with < 
the code will run and the image will be loaded

thanks
Muhammed
