Summary:

The current ownCloud Windows Desktop client is prone to an arbitrary code injection vulnerability.

The underlying issue is that the ownCloud desktop client tries to load QT extensions from C:\usr\i686-w64-mingw32\sys-root\mingw\lib\qt5\plugins.

As any authenticated user on Windows is allowed to create new folders within C:, the expected folder structure can be created.

What that means is that a local attacker can create a malicious QT extensions that gets automatically loaded on the next launch of the ownCloud Desktop client.

To verify the issue I first tried to simply create a new QT imageformats plugin. However I failed! Have you ever tried to install QT? So I decided to simply modify an existing DLL.

Hence, I used Hopper to disassemble the qwindows.dll platformâ€™s library to learn more about its entry points. With that knowledge I planned to modify the DLL so that it shows a simply message box. The necessary shellcode was created with Metasploit:

msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/messagebox TEXT="DLL Loaded" EXTIFUNC=process -f raw > shellcode
cat shellcode |xxd -p

I then overwrote some bytes after one of the previously identified DLL entry points with the shellcode.

After placing the modified payload DLL into C:\usr\i686-w64-mingw32\sys-root\mingw\lib\qt5\plugins\platforms the shellcode got executed after launching the ownCloud desktop client.

Please see the attached PDF for some images documenting the process.
Furthermore I created a private screen capture: https://owncloud.bogner.sh/s/Ik8AYJ9FfY5Rkyq
