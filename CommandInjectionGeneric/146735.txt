Summary:

Dear Sir,

I am going to share information about content spoofing vulnerability present in 404 page. This vulnerability may not consider as in-scope but you can put it as informative.

Description :

"Content spoofing, also referred to as content injection or virtual defacement, is an attack targeting a user made possible by an injection vulnerability in a web application. When an application does not properly handle user supplied data, an attacker can supply content to a web application, typically via a parameter value, that is reflected back to the user. "

Attacker can modify page content in a way that "The requested URL /https://eng.uber.com has been changed to https://www.fakewebsite.com. so please visit https://www.fakewebsite.com as your requested link was not found on this server."

Affected URL: https://eng.uber.com
