Summary:

As an admin of a company, I can set my company name to be something like "=1+1", which, when downloaded by me or anyone else with permission to access that file, will execute and show "2" in the excel file.

While this may seem safe, I am able to make the name something more malicious, such as "-2+3+cmd|' /C calc'!D2", which can be used to execute arbitrary commands in Excel.

A recommended fix for this is to escape special excel "trigger" characters that cause commands to be executed.
