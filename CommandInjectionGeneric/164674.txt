Summary:

Hello, Ian!

I see you tried to escape "=, -, +, @" in your code ([#151516](https://hackerone.com/reports/151516)), but let me show simple workaround.

I've made CSV injection by using this string ";=cmd|' /C calc'!A5" without doublequotes.

";" will bypass your trying to set the quote in the beginning of the string.

";" acts as a new cell separator.

Tested in the Excel 2016
