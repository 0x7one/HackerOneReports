Summary:

Hello guys,

**_Details:_**
Well, initially I was testing for CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) Injection, but how turned out, I was able to inject cookie without CRLF, just via # value at HTTP Request.

**_PoC:_**
Attacker able to inject new cookie from any application place, e.g.
`https://testerovusera.harvestapp.com/people/1412277/edit#NewLocalCookieKey=NewLocalCookieValue`
in this case cookie will be created to following path, and will be valid only there: _/people/1412277/_
**but**, it could be bypassed, if append root application path, e.g.
`https://testerovusera.harvestapp.com/people/1412277/edit#NewGlobalCookieKey=NewGlobalCookieValue;path=/;/`
{F126502}

**_Attacking scenario:_**
This vulnerability perfectly could be used in combination with other vulnerabilities:
- XSS thru Cookie;
- Session Fixation;
- CSRF protection bypass

**_Recommendation:_**
Properly validate what is going to cookie jar

Thank you,
Stas
