Summary:
A mistake in our compilation meant that one of our Qt libraries was unintentionally loading a openssl.cnf from another user on Windows. The config file allowed the other user to specify a DLL to load, which meant that a user with this specific username could escalate privileges and execute code as another user running Dropbox. @fbogner was extremely helpful and also gave us scripts to detect it.
