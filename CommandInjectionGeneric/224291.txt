Summary:

Hi,

The "Download as a CSV" feature of Weblate does not properly "escape" fields. Here is more information about this issue: http://www.contextis.com/resources/blog/comma-separated-vulnerabilities/

Here is one method to reproduce this issue:

1) I can add new information in Glossary with a name starting with "=1+1;" or "-2+3+cmd|' /C calc'!G2;"
2) I choose to export all Glossary to CSV containing the issue in (1)
3) I now open this CSV file in excel or another spreadsheet program
4) You can see the cell containing the issue name in (1) is displayed as "2" (=1+1;) which means the code is executed.
