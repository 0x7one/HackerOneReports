Summary:

Hello,

When an administrator attempts to set an avatar from an external link, the parser just takes the source of whatever link they point it to and creates a file with the same extension and content in the uploads folder.

##Steps to reproduce:

1- Visit http://[HOST]/admin.php?/cp/members/profile/settings and scroll to the "Change avatar" section.
2- Choose "Link to avatar" and set it's value to `http://strukt.tk/test.svg`
3- After redirection, if you have a proxy, a request will be made to something like `http://[HOST]/images/avatars/test_1.svg` on your localhost. Try opening that in your browser and you should see an alert box over there.
4- You can try that with `https://ellislab.com/asset/file/ee_server_wizard.zip`, it will create a .zip file over there.

That being said, an attacker can use other file types and may be able to run arbitrary commands on the OS.

Regards
