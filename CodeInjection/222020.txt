Summary:
### Mercurial 4.1.3 (2017-4-18)

- `hg serve --stdio` could be tricked into granting authorized users access to the Python debugger. Thanks to Jonathan Claudius of Mozilla for reporting this issue. This issue is only a security issue for repositories served using --stdio, which includes ssh but *not* http.
I reported this bug privately to Mercurial and they produced an out of band release to fix the bug here:

https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/WhatsNew#Mercurial_4.1.3_.282017-4-18.29

I produced a very detailed proof of concept with a Metasploit exploit module, which can be seen publicly here:

https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/8263

The TLDR is that many services which host Mercurial servers often write their own hg-ssh wrapper or heavily customize the hg-ssh wrapper.  If the customized wrapped does not explicitly validate user input to the repo attribute, an attacker can supply a string of "--debugger", which causes the internal hg binary to drop to a Pdb shell, which allows arbitrary Python code execution.

I'm submitting to this program because I believe source code management software like git and mercurial is considered critical infrastructure for the Internet.
