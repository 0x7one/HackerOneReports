Summary:
While Trello had patched our image libraries to prevent the RCE vulnerability in ImageMagick, we had not applied a patch to prevent arbitrary file reads via `label`s in `mvg` files.

After resolving the issue, we were able to determine that no files had actually been accessed using this vulnerability, beyond the ones in @theflofly's proof of concept.
