Summary:
The link to Uberâ€™s privacy policy was using the unencrypted `http://` scheme, making it possible for an attacker with the ability to Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) traffic. This would allow them to replace normal responses with malicious content such as a phishing page. The content would then render within the Uber application, making for a credible phishing attack.
