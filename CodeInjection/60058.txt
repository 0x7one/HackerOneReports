Summary:

Hello udemy

your site teach.udemy.com has its debug.log publically available consisting of 1 gb of debug logs. The logs don't expose critical information except for some user ip addresses, mail-addresses and other info, but it may lead to remote code execution,since the logs also store user agent values. If an attacker makes a request that makes it to the debug.log file, he can execute arbitrary code through his spoofed user-agent.  To fix this issue, you can turn debugging off in your wp-config.php file

the debug.log is avaiable at https://teach.udemy.com/wp-content/debug.log

If you have any additional questions about this vulnerability, feel free to ask.

Best regards
