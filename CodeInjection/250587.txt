Summary:

Under /system/ee/legacy/libraries/Functions.php, function delete_directory contains calls to `exec` 3 times using different, potentially "unsanitized" paramateres. As the PHP manual suggest, `escapeshellarg` should be used to sanitize individual arguments [1]. 

On an implementation in which the attacker controls the file name, arbitrary code execution is achieved. Better to fix it.
