Summary:

Under `./system/ee/legacy/libraries/Image_lib.php`

There are function from CodeIgniter to manipulate images. The issue is that the PHP function `exec` is used two times in two different functions: `image_process_imagemagick` and `image_process_netpbm`

In both cases the `full_src_path` and `full_dst_path` are given unescaped to the `exec` function. If an attacker can control the filename of the image to give he can inject pretty much arbitrary code. I suggest to use `escapeshellarg` on the path arguments at rows:
-590
-604
-608
-691

Furthermore, note that in CodeIgniter Github repo, the function `image_process_imagemagick` that already prevents this potential injection.
