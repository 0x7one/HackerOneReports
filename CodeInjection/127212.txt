Summary:

PHP <= 7.0.4/5.5.34 contained a format string vulnerability in php_snmp_error() at ext/snmp/snmp.c:533, because snmp_object->snmp_errstr was passed directly to zend_throw_exception_ex() without a "%s".  This issue appears to have been present across all PHP versions.  In testing, I have been able to leverage this vulnerability for full code-execution by abusing PHP's internal "%Z" (zval) format specifier.  In the interest of good ol' PoC, that exploit is attached.  :)

This issue has been patched in PHP v7.0.5
