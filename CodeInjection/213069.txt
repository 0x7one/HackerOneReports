Summary:
A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability was found on a DoD website which could have enabled an attacker to execute remote commands on the web server. @0daystolive and @dly were able to demonstrate this vulnerability by developing a custom script that caused the webserver to execute a benign command. This was a very clever demonstration. Thank you!
