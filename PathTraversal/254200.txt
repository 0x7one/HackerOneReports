Summary:
Thanks again @sp1d3rs, also for the summary. Nothing to add from our side except maybe for the wish for more reports having this quality.

Final comment: nothing from that bucket was ever exposed to any user except the uploader, also nothing in the bucket is there for real archiving purposes.
