Summary:

Hi,

A crafted request can be leveraged to traverse the directory structure of a host using the `featurebook` server package, and request arbitrary files outside of the specified web root.

## Module specification
* **Name**: [featurebook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/featurebook)
* **Version**: 0.0.32 (latest release build)

## Verified conditions
* **Test server:** Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

## Proof of concept

Please globally install the `featurebook` package and `cd` to a chosen directory (in this case, `/root`) on your test server. Run `featurebook serve --port 8081` to start serving from this location.

Substituting the `<server-IP>` value as appropriate, please browse to the following URL in Chrome. This will request the target `/etc/passwd` file and echo it line-by-line into an error message:

```
http://<server-IP>:8081/#/viewer/..%2f..%2fetc/passwd
```

Thanks,

## Impact

An adversary can leverage this vulnerability to request arbitrary files from the target host, which may include application source code or system configuration data.
