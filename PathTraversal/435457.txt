Summary:

Hello Imgur Administrators,

I am not sure if this falls in your scope but I wanted to alert you that your Nexus Repository Manager can be accessed through https://nexus.imgur.com/
Usually the default user/pass for the NRM are admin/admin123 but there is an alternative way to login using the below default credentials.
user: anonymous
pass: anonymous

I was able to login and I got access to check all the repositories available. I uploaded the attached video as a proof of traversal.
Kindly arrange to remove the user anonymous or change its password & limit the access to the Nexus Repo Manager site https://nexus.imgur.com/

## Impact

The attacker can manage to proxy, collect, and manage your dependencies (delete components & Analyze applications).
