# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

statichttpserver is simply get the path name of url and add it to the web root. it means if you input ../, it will happy add it to web root and you can list the folder you choose. But the trick is web browser or curl are also to try rebuild the url containing ../. I used the burp to make a raw url and send it to server.

## Steps To Reproduce:

install `statichttpserver`
`$ npm install -g statichttpserver`

start program
`$ StaticHTTPServer --ip 192.168.220.132`

start burpsuite and enter the url contain ../. you should see the files in the folder.
