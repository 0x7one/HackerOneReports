Reporter:https://hackerone.com/rohitdua

Summary:

I. Vulnerability
---------------------
IRCCloud is affected by Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in its badges page. (www.irccloud.com/badges)

II. Description
---------------------
IRCCloud is open to parameter pollution attacks ie. a parameter passed more than once with different values results in varying different results.
This bug is used to leverage an XSS in the badges page.

####POC link:
```
www.irccloud.com/badges?hostname=hostname" type="text/javascript"> /*&hostname=*/alert('XSS\n-Rohit Dua'); //
```
If  you visit the link a javascript pops up showing the message 'XSS - Rohit Dua'. (screenshot_irccloud.png)

Even after parameter pollution, the attack is ineffective due to strong XSS filters(possibly firewall)
The _filter evasion_ is possible due a certain combination of javascript comments in the url that combine and comment out the unneeded part.
