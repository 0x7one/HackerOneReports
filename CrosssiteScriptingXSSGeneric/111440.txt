Hi,
You are using Wistia to embed video at trello.com. However external script from fast.wistia.com vulnerable to XSS and allows to run malicious javascript on your side. 
vulnerable code:
 fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js

I found that parameter `wchannel` can be controled to load js from 
http://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1/channels/[controled input].js
 example:
https://trello.com/guide/customize.html?wchannel=../../../../xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
browser tryied to load script from:
https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1/channels/xxxxxxx.js

And now the only thing we need is to find the way how to upload malicious script to fast.wistia.com.
I wasnt able to upload something but i found that i can control outpoot of a json file via `callback` parameter:
`https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/[video id].json?callback=[controlled outpoot]`
 proof:
https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/1yqpy8ics4.json?callback=alert(1)%3Bvar%20x=%27%3bx(//

okay now we can attack trello:
