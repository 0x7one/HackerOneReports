Summary:
The researcher discovered a POST based XSS on an administrative login page on our careers.razerzone.com website that would have allowed the execution of scripts in some browsers (e.g. Firefox).  This was fixed on 1/5.

Another great report.  We'd also like to acknowledge the researcher's effort in working with us when we prematurely marked the issue as Fixed when it was still pending for production.
