Hello __Team__

__Abstract__:-
A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was found in the MailPoet Newsletters plugin. This issue allows an attacker to perform a wide variety of actions, such as stealing Administrators' session tokens, or performing arbitrary actions on their behalf. In order to exploit this issue, the attacker has to lure/force a logged on WordPress Administrator into opening a URL provided by an attacker.

__Introduction__:-
The MailPoet Newsletters plugin allows a WordPress administrator to create newsletters, automated emails, post notifications and autoresponders. A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was found in the MailPoet Newsletters plugin. This issue allows an attacker to perform a wide variety of actions, such as stealing Administrators' session tokens, or performing arbitrary actions on their behalf. In order to exploit this issue, the attacker has to lure/force a logged on WordPress Administrator into opening a URL provided by an attacker.

__Proof of concept__:-
Have an authenticated admin visit the URL:-

The encodedForm parameter is the base64 encoded string:
{"form":"Pwn","after_widget":"<script>alert('XSS)</script>"}

A pop-up box should appear, meaning the JavaScript contained in the request_id request parameter was executed by the browser.
