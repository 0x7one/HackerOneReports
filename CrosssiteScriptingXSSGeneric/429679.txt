Summary:

Hello Shopify team! I found a post-based XSS which may be shared to other users and occurs in firefox, IE, Edge.

How to reproduce:
1. at partners.shopify.com go to apps -> choose one -> more actions -> create shopify app store listing
2. you will get redirected to url with ?signature parameter. Full copy whole URL.
3. as App name specify </script><svg onload=alert()>
4. in incognito tab open URL copied in step 2
5. click Preview changes

How to fix: 

Sanitize parameters which are getting inserted in <script> tag.

## Impact

POST-based XSS in firefox/ie/edge. probably safari too
