Summary:
On April 28th, 2016 @dawgyg reported a reflected cross-site scripting issue in the map embed page of our v4 map API that affected Firefox users only. An attacker could manipulate the `access_token` query string parameter on `api.mapbox.com` or `api.tiles.mapbox.com` to inject arbitrary JavaScript that would then execute in the context of the page. 

The attack exploited an interpolated [underscore template](http://underscorejs.org/#template) (`<%=`) that did not HTML-escape the value. In addition, Firefox does not `encodeURIComponent()` the single quote character (`%27` or `'`) in the address bar. Both of these factors allowed an attacker to add a single quote character to break out of several `meta` HTML elements on our map embed page and add arbitrary `script` elements for Firefox users.

To resolve this issue we switched to HTML-escaped underscore templates (`<%-`). We deployed the fix to our servers and resolved the issue on April 29th, 2016.

This report only affected infrastructure running on `api.mapbox.com` and `api.tiles.mapbox.com` - it did not affect any of Mapbox's open source libraries such as mapbox.js or Mapbox GL JS. In addition, this issue also only affected Firefox users - Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer users were not affected.
There is a reflective XSS vulnerability in the access_token param found in the page.html at api.tiles.mapbox.com
