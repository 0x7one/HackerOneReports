Severity:
State:Closed

Summary:

The **return_to** parameter is not validated properly, which allows an attacker to execute javascript via the **data:** protocol:

> https://login.newrelic.com/login?return_to=data:text/html%3Bbase64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgxKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg%3D%3D

Despite being executed not in the newrelic domain, the script still can be used for some purposes like, for example, redirection to phishing pages.

An example of redirection to google.com:
