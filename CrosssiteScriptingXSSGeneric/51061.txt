WeaknessName:Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic
Reporter:https://hackerone.com/ddworken
ReportedTo:Mail.ru(mailru)
BountyAmount:
Severity:
State:Closed
DateOfDisclosure:02.05.2015 17:33:59

Summary:

The XSS vulnerability is located here:

```
https://ad.mail.ru/adi/3030
```

and is triggered by setting referer to:

```
"><script>alert(0)</script>
```

The problem is that the referer is being loaded like so:

```html
 <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4831681952934476" data-ad-slot="7515917252" data-override-format="true" data-page-url = "">
<script>
    alert(0)
</script>">
```

I am aware that this is out of scope, but I am still reporting it since I just happened to spot it while looking for other bugs.
