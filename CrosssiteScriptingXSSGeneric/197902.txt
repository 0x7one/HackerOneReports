Summary:

Hello!

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Paste this payload URL in the topic: http://89.223.28.48/og_image.html?uncache1234
2. Save the post and you will see the XSS will fire
{F151911}

Though you now escape the OpenGraph data, the whitelisted_generic onebox engine decodes variables values back at lines: [202](https://github.com/discourse/onebox/blob/master/lib/onebox/engine/whitelisted_generic_onebox.rb#L202) and [207](https://github.com/discourse/onebox/blob/master/lib/onebox/engine/whitelisted_generic_onebox.rb#L207).
Then these decoded values are injected in the raw HTML [here](https://github.com/discourse/onebox/blob/master/lib/onebox/engine/whitelisted_generic_onebox.rb#L284) and [here](https://github.com/discourse/onebox/blob/master/lib/onebox/engine/whitelisted_generic_onebox.rb#L289) that leads to XSS attack possibility.

Example post with stored XSS inside is: https://try.discourse.org/t/testing-is-in-progress/620
