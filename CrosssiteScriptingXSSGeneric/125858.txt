Summary:

Hi there,


I have found that in many input fields the input is not properly sanitized and the values are directly inserted into the JavaScript code and the html code.

## PoC:

1- Log in into the account.
2- Create a group with the following name `group_name');alert(document.cookie);//`
3-Try to Add Members from Member Book. (or delete the group).
4-The code will get executed. 

In addition, the code will get executed and the action could be also executed without problem. That make that the user do not notice what is happening behind those actions.

This Issue it could be replicated also in: Groups (add member and delete), Venues (for delete button).


I attach two pictured where you can see the injected code and the xss executed.

Best Regards,
Joel
