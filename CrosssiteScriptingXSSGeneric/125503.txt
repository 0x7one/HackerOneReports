Summary:

Hey Uber Team, 

although you are excluding self stored XSS i am reporting this one because it could be exploited by someone with more skills then i have :-) :

1. Login to your profile and change the address to : â€œ#><img src=x onerror=prompt(1);>
2. Go to https://partners.uber.com/fuel_cards/enroll 
3. The JS will pop up
