Summary:

First of all [here] (https://hackerone.com/reports/115402) is another report looks like this report. 

Zomato using APIs for developers to create their restaurant search etc. 

You are using res_search_widget which is can be seen right [here] (https://www.zomato.com/widgets/res_search_widget.php). 

In the report which is 115402 number that i mentioned start of the report, reporter say something like this: 

I use a piece of javascript code that creates an alert box with the document.domain, which shows the SOP is bypassed: "}');alert(document.domain);console.log('.  But you dont need to add something to your API or widget code. You should only use '"> characters to bypass security and have xss alert.

So, here is xss:

Just go to your widget from [here](https://www.zomato.com/widgets/res_search_widget.php).

And just write this payload:

`'-->">'>'"<script>prompt(document.domain)</script>;" f0r=TRUE`

Here is your alert.
