Summary:
Reflected XSS in auto.mail.ru (out of scope)
Hi. I found multiple vulnerabilities in mail.ru subdomains, affecting many mail.ru users and putting them at risk. Here are the details:

AFFECTED DOMAINS:

http://torg.mail.ru/---------------UI Redress (Clickjacking)
https://pogoda.mail.ru/---------------UI Redress (Clickjacking)
https://auto.mail.ru/ ------------XSS
http://s1.amigo.mail.ru/---------------UI Redress (Clickjacking)
https://top.mail.ru/---------------UI Redress (Clickjacking)

POC 1: (Clickjacking)

<html>
<head>
<title>Clickjacking POC</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>vulnerable to clickjacking</p>
<iframe src="https://pogoda.mail.ru/" width="500" height="500"></iframe>
</body>
</html>

*Just change the subdomains (those vulnerable to clickjacking) to see the effect

POC 2: (XSS)

1. Go to https://auto.mail.ru/ 
2. In the searchbar, enter the XSS payload: <img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>
3. Click Enter
4. XSS pop up

Impact: An attacker can host this domain in other evil site by using iframe and if a user fill the given filed it can directly redirect as logs to attacker and after its redirect to your web server.. its lead to steal user information too and use that host site as phishing of your site its CSRF and Clickjacking. Can lead to CSRF too...Impact: An attacker can host this domain in other evil site by using iframe and if a user fill the given filed it can directly redirect as logs to attacker and after its redirect to your web server.. its lead to steal user information too and use that host site as phishing of your site its CSRF and Clickjacking.

Possible fix: Recommended fix is to add the HTTP header X FRAME OPTIONS and set it to DENY

I hope you consider my report, POC attached for XSS...

Thanks
