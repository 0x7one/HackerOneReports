Summary:

On the cfire.mail.ru/screen/1/ page, the following HTML is generated:
``` html
<link rel="canonical" href="//cfire.mail.ru/screen/1/">
```

By appending "><script>alert(0)</script> to the end of the URL, an XSS vulnerability is triggered causing the javascript code: ``` alert(0) ``` to execute. 

So the final URL to trigger this vulnerability is: 

```https://cfire.mail.ru/screen/1/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(0)%3C/script%3E```

Note that the page does not matter, this vulnerability will also be triggered when 1 is replaced with 2,3,etc.
