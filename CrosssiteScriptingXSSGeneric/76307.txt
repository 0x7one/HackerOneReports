Summary:

Self XSS Protection not used , I can trick users to insert JavaScript
I see that you have not enabled "Self XSS Protection not used" on gratipay.com This technique prevents user from getting tricked into injecting js themselves

For example, Facebook have : http://gyazo.com/3b448c200124053b60b622d0149e242d

But you don't have it, You should Have it to protect users , it tells users not to get tricked and be safe. Its a best practise every website should follow for a safer web!


This bug has been fixed by many websites including Facebook. So its strongly advised you to fix it.
