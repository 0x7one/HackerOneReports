Summary:
ThisData (formerly Revert) provides the ability to backup Dropbox files. File names were rendered within the app in an unescaped manner, meaning if you could get Dropbox to accept a file with a name like `"><img src="x" onerror=alert(cookie)>.png` you could XSS Revert's backup rendering screen.
