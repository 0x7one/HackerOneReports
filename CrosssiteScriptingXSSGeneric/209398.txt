Summary:
##Issue

The reporter found a form which contained an HTML-injection vector. By misusing the form, an attacker could send out legitimate looking emails with a link to a malicious site. The prospect for successful phishing is limited, as the contents of the emails sent out are defined in the application itself, but by playing around with different injections, the possibility of crafting realistic emails was still there.

##Fix

The form was removed.

##Reasoning

The issue was not highly critical, but still posed a valid vector for spoofing.
