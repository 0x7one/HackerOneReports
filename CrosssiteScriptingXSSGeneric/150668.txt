Summary:

Hello,

The OLX.PL is vulnerable to stored XSS attack.
When adding new advertisement, it is possible to put a payload in its title (here I used Title<script>alert(1)</script>

I see ads are being pre-moderated, however it can remain uncaught also the length limit in title field is enough to insert into it e.g. a BeEF hook so it will invisible hack moderator's browser. 
Assuming there are unsolved session fixation issues this may lead to takeover of moderator's cookie and impersonating him

This input should be validated properly, e.g. a whitelist of chracters that can be used - aplhanum + some chars like .,!? but no html 

Please see screenshots as a PoC

Cheers
Lukasz
