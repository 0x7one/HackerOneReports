Summary:

Hi , 

As we know , XSS is a security breach that takes advantage of dynamically generated Web pages. In an XSS attack, a Web application is sent with a script that activates when it is read by an unsuspecting user s browser or by an application that has not protected itself against cross-site scripting.

Affected plugin - Sucuri Security - Auditing, Malware Scanner (  https://wordpress.org/plugins/sucuri-scanner/  ) 

A xss vulnerability has been identified that allows an attacker to bypass security scanning process & to redirect some malicious place or simply hijack session cookies .

Proof of concept :--
[1] Install Sucuri Security - Auditing, Malware Scanner in your WP site
[2] Make a file <img src=xx onerror=prompt(document.cookie)>.png in root directory of your WordPress site
[3] Now , go to xyz.tld/wp-admin/admin.php?page=sucuriscan
[4] Multiple XSS will be triggered with cookie information prompt will be shown ,  confirming the existence of XSS via file name manipulation .

Impact :- 
[1] Redirect to some malicious place
[2] Simply hijack session cookies .
[3] Bypass scanning process 


XSS where it is reflected :- 

[1]   <tr class=" sucuriscan-hidden">
    <td class="check-column">
        <input type="checkbox" name="sucuriscan_integrity_files[]" value="'""><img src=xx onerror=prompt(0)>.png" />

[2]   <span class="sucuriscan-monospace sucuriscan-wraptext">'""><img src=xx onerror=prompt(0)>.png</span>
