Summary:

Note, the shared folder part of this bug isn't necessary for this exploit, but shows a proof of concept on how you can exploit other users.

This bug is a [cross site scripting vulnerablity](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_%28XSS%29) (XSS), which allows arbitrary scripts (commonly javascript) supplied by an attacker to be run within the context of the victims browser.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a dropbox account
2. Create a folder
3. Invite victim to collaborate with new folder ([instructions](https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/19)).
4. Create a file called test.html within the folder with the contents below.

    <html><body><script>alert(document.domain);</body></html>

For victim to run the exploit, they need to take the following steps

1. Accept invitation to collaborate
2. Open shared folder, select the file test.html (not to preview, just to the side of the name, so that you can do next step).
3. Above file listings, the option "Previous versions" should be available, click on that
4. Click on the vulnerable version, it should open a URL such as https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/sharedfoldername/test.html?some unique parameters
5. Observe XSS alert (would be more malicious in practise). Note that the domain is dl-web.dropbox.domain, which is included in the bounty brief as *.dropbox.com

Note that you don't *need* to share the folder, the original user can see the exploit, but would be considered Self-XSS, so the sharing is needed to make this attack possible on other drop box users.

Note that any filetype that would be rendered by the browser and can run scripts is fine, such as svg, xhtml, etc.

If requested, I can make a screencast and/or screenshots of this vulnerability.

Thank you for your time in reading this report, please let me know if you have any questions or clarifications needed.
