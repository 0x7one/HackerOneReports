Summary:
For an in-depth analysis, check out the **[post-mortem posted on CSPR.NG](https://cspr.ng/blog/2016/07/cms-airship-1-1-2-stored-xss-post-mortem)**.

Lessons learned:

1. If you rely on auto-escaping, make *sure* it's being applied everywhere. Where it's not applied, escape manually.
2. Be more skeptical of patterns intended to promote i18n.
3. Turn off `Content-Security-Policy` headers when testing locally so it's easier to catch these failures.

I'm just checking out CMS Airship and some of the security features look pretty nice. Awesome job on that!

After clicking around a bit I stumbled however upon a stored XSS vulnerability in the Bridge.  As per `/bridge/help` I use 1.1.0 version (installed via Docker), as I couldn't find any reference with regard to this in the 1.1.1 changelog from https://github.com/paragonie/airship/commit/29dc60a1b0178222c3c984915f2eda6322ca3453 I believe that it probably is affected as well.

To reproduce this:

1. Install CMS Airship
2. Make sure to use the default settings (or at least do not uncheck "Enable registration")
3. Take another browser tab and go to http://localhost:8081/bridge/board to register a new account
4. Login with that account at http://localhost:8081/bridge/login
5. Go to http://localhost:8080/bridge/author/new
6. Create a new author with the name "<script>alert(1)</script>"
7. Send the author edit link to another user, such as the captain user (e.g. http://localhost:8080/bridge/author/edit/3)
8. Open it as captain

Then you see the XSS executed, or well, if your browser supports CSP a decent CSP warning in your browser console :-)

The HTML in question is:

```
    <div id="bridge_main">    <h2>Edit Author "<script>alert(1)</script>" Details</h2>
<form method="post"><input type="hidden" name="_CSRF_TOKEN" value="ijYiRqBM1DKBw9Kevvn4zjEw:frKdBMZxXK3VUgI0ZEuQHdHerw9NnVwTx8a62QiJhiY3" />
    <div class="table full-width table-pad-1">
        <div class="table-row">
            <div class="table-cell table-label">
                <label for="author_name">Author Name:</label>
            </div>
            <div class="table-cell">
                <input class="full-width" id="author_name" name="name" placeholder="e.g.&#x20;Information&#x20;Technology&#x20;Department" value="&lt;script&gt;alert&#x28;1&#x29;&lt;&#x2F;script&gt;" type="text" />
            </div>
        </div>
```

Since I don't have libsodium and PECL installed locally on my dev machine I couldn't include a tested patch for this. Sorry :-)
