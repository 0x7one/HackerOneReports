Summary:

Hi,

On my previous report (number 126464) I've mentioned that 
analytics.twitter.com has a CSP bypass which I couldn't exploit that time.

Now, I've found a reflected XSS on careers.twitter.com which again I couldn't exploit by itself. Because you have CSP, and I've combined two of them to successfully trigger XSS.

If you visit the url:
https://careers.twitter.com/en/jobs-search.html?location=1%22%3E%3Cscript%20src=//analytics.twitter.com/tpm?tpm_cb=alert%28document.domain%29%3E//

you will see xss triggered. 

Regards.
