Summary:

Hi!

The page at https://connect.squareup.com/sessions/new doesn't properly sanitize the "email" parameter and/or the input field for email. Since the site is built with AngularJS and the email field is a binded field (child of ng-app), we can inject an AngularJS template. Normally, you aren't supposed to be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript from AngularJS templates, but I managed to bypass the AngularJS sandbox (I have contacted them as well). This means we have a reflected XSS. 

PoC: https://connect.squareup.com/sessions/new?return_to=%2Fapps&email={{toString.constructor.prototype.toString=toString.constructor.prototype.call%3b[%22a%22,%22alert(1)%22].sort(toString.constructor)}}

Sincerely,
Mathias
