Summary:

Hi there,

I found a Cross Site Scripting in the bookfresh website, what I found it to be significant is, its publicly facing.

Any user who points his browser to : [Proof of Concept XSS](https://www.bookfresh.com/cindex.php/account/reactivate?email=admin@cliffordtrigo.info"><script>confirm(1)</script>). **Use Firefox**

Then will be greeted by a javascript pop up.

Kindly have a look sir.

Cheers,
Clifford
