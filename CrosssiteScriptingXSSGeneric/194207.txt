Summary:
##Issue

The reporter found a reflected XSS in verkkopalvelu.lahitapiola.fi but later discovered that the vulnerability also allowed open and unvalidated redirects. 

##Fix

The issue was mitigated.

##Reasoning

An XSS as such is not a huge issue from a risk perspective, although it poses a small risk for stealing of credentials. Open redirects allow for far more sophisticated attack vectors using mass phishing emails and a customized malicious login page.
