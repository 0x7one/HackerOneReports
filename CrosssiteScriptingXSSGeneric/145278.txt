Summary:

Hey,

this vulnerability is essentially the same as bug 145276, i'm reporting it again just in case.

there's a cross site scripting vulnerability in https://www.uber.com/.

steps to reproduce:

1.visit https://www.uber.com/?kxsrc=https%3A//beacon.krxd.net/optout_check%3Fcallback%3Dalert%28/XSSED/.source%29
2. wait until the page finishes loading
3.see the xss alert.

wonder it would be eligible for a bounty?

Cheers,
Mario
