Summary:

Whenever a new team is created, Slackbot uses automated profile completion by asking a few questions from the user like the first name, last name, skype account etc. But instead of providing the correct details we provide `<javascript:alert(document.cookie);>` as input then Slackbot will cause the data go inside the anchor tag `<a href=javascript:alert(document.cookie);>...</a>` so clicking on the link will trigger XSS.
