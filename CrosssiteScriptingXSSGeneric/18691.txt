Summary:

# Steps 

+ Open any editor in phabricator where memes can be used (literally anywhere :P)
+ Enter the following and save it & **BOOM**

```
{meme, src= http://dummy//onerror=eval(prompt(1))// }
```

# Why ?

+ Nested parsing is causing the src value to be treated as a link which is automatically made link by fabricator. So, a whole mess-up of syntax happening there.
+ ```\\``` are being used as space separators since those replaced.

# Fix ?

+ May be to avoid nested parsing, it messes up things. But the choice is yours since you have more knowledge of the application needs
