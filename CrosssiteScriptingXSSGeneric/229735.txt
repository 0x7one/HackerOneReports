Summary:

##Description
I saw the fixed issue in the https://hackerone.com/reports/223692 and i think i found another filter bypass. I noticed that we actually can use special keywords like %(branch)s, %(file)s and %(line)s.
So XSS can be achieved in this way:
`%(branch)s:alert(1);//https://`
if the branch will be named `javascript`, the payload will be executed upon pressing the source code link of the file inside it.

##Steps to reproduce
1. Create some branch and name it javascript
2. Put some source files.
3. Click the link on source file. The `%(branch)s` will be replaced by branch name (`javascript`) and popup will be fired.

##Suggested fix
I recommend you to additionally sanitize string by disallowing special symbolst before first `:` occurence (if exist)
