Summary:

Hi,
I have found a stored XSS vulnerability in `[shop].myshopify.com/admin/orders/[id]` in conversion details links, it's the same as #55842 but this one is through landing page URL not the referrer.

**Steps to reproduce**: 
1. Navigate to `[shop].myshopify.com/` 
2. Modify `_landing_page` cookie value to `javascript:alert(1)`
{F169421}
3. Add a product to your cart then complete the checkout process.
4. Login with an admin account then navigate to `[shop].myshopify.com/admin/orders/[id]` and click the link for **The first page they visited** and `alert(1)` will be executed.
{F169422}

**Impact**:
This is a customer-to-admin XSS, so an attacker can target admins to do malicious actions such as fetching the CSRF token and using it to submit a request to add himself as an admin to takeover the store.
