Summary:

Hi,
As discussed in #151561 submitting the report here.

I have got some more bugs in Camptix Event Ticketing plugin.

Well, the first one is a ticket page xss caused by the **Ticket Title**
And the second one is kind of self-xss, caused by also the **Ticket title** of the plugin but in the coupons page.
I have added a video *PoC* for your clarification with step by step reproduction.
As I have seen in #9391 you've fixed self-xss, I have created this report.

I think both of the bugs should be fixed.

I expect you fix both of them.
