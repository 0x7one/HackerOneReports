Summary:

Hi,

I created a class called `"><img src=x onerror=alert(4)>`, I hope that you know how to make a class..
After that, when you go to https://www.khanacademy.org/coach/reports/activity and select a class it might not load directly but when you reloud the page it will (and persistent).

Best regards,

Olivier Beg
