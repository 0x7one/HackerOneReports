Summary:

SupportFlow contains an XSS vulnerability in how it handles ticket subjects in the admin-side ticket form, because the subject is not escaped before being used in the `value` attribute of the subject input element.

This first requires wptexturize to be disabled (not that uncommon):

```add_filter( 'run_wptexturize', '__return_false' );```

Then, create a ticket with a subject like this:

```
"><script>alert('hi');</script>
```

The next time someone views that ticket (any other user) in the admin area at _SupportFlow -> All Tickets -> [Ticket]_, XSS is triggered.

This is due to this line not using `esc_attr()` on the title value (core does not do this automatically):

I've attached a screenshot demonstrating the XSS `alert` - please let me know if you have any questions or if I can clarify anything.
