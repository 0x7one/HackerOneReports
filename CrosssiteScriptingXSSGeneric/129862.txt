WeaknessName:Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic

Summary:

I have found a stored XSS in the Facebook Channel options at ```https://[your_zendesk].zendesk.com/agent/admin/facebook/facebook_auth```.

The XSS is a result of improperly escaping Facebook Page names.

Steps to reproduce
-------------------------

1. Create a facebook page with the following title/page name:

    ```Foobar" onmouseover=location&#x3d;'javascript:alert\x28document.domain\x29'```

    (I had to play around with this a bit to get it working correctly as Facebook has strict policies on the page name. If the page already exists, try to replace `Foobar` with any other random string)
2. Create your own zendesk account and then go to ```https://[your_zendesk].zendesk.com/agent/admin/facebook/facebook_auth``` to add a facebook page.
3. After adding the page created in Step 1, hover over the "Unlink" button to trigger the XSS. See also attached screenshot.

Attack scenario
--------------------
Obviously anyone with the permissions to add facebook pages can trigger this stored XSS and attack the admins with the usual XSS attacks.
