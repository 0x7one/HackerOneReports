Summary:

Hi Trello,

When I was uploading image attachments from my computer,I've realized that I can upload SVG files and then I've tried to look SVG file that I attached,and I understood you execute SVG files which is can be malicious redirecting to a website  or executing javascript codes for members.
Steps to reproduce

PoC:

1-Go to your Trello account
2-Click any activity
3-From attachments click on "Upload File" then click "Computer"
4-Then upload svg files that I gave you
5-From activities click on svg files
6-You'll be redirected to example.com or XSS will execute

And if you want you can watch my poc video that can be helpful for you

How To Fox:

You should stop executing svg files and display its's code like HTML,as you know SVG files can be used like HTML codes which is dangerous.

Thanks Trello,
Have a nice day !
