WeaknessName:Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic

Summary:

It's possible to inject angular expressions into the account settings of a new relic account. This, combined with an angular sandbox escape allows for persistant cross-site scripting which is executed in the browser of any user visiting the affected page. The execution of which could be used to redirect users to a malicious page and potentially hijack their session tokens or other sensitive data.

For example, the accounts usage page.

Steps to reproduce.

1) As an account user with admin priveleges, change the account name e.g. https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/1310893/

to the following Angular expression:

{{'a'.constructor.prototype.charAt=[].join;$eval('x=alert(1)');}}

2) Now if we login as a seperate user (alice) we'll have the XSS execute as its stored in the page.

The sandbox did prevent the usae of many potentially dangerous contructors, however the version of Angular has publicized sandbox escapes.
