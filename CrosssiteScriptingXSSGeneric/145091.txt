Summary:

SupportFlow containers a stored XSS vulnerability in how it generates the admin table of tickets at _SupportFlow -> All Tickets_ (`/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=sf_ticket`).

Any ticket can be created with an XSS payload like this:

```
<script>alert('XSS');</script>
```

When an admin goes to view the table of tickets, XSS is triggered, because the value is never escaped here:

I've attached a screenshot demonstrating the XSS payload - please let me know if there are any questions.
