Summary:

Hello,

It is possible to inject javascript code to a message for another user. Please see steps to reproduce below:

1. Go to user page
2. Click "Send a message" button (there are two buttons on the profile page, no matter which one you choose)
3. Send a message like the following:

test xss <img src="/" onerror="alert(document.cookie)"/>

If a user goes to "Messages" -> "Sent" page and chooses a conversation you created, the code doesn't run. But if a user clicks "Pop out" button, it does.

An attacker can't steal a session id because the application uses HttpOnly cookies:

Set-Cookie: override_session=0; Expires=Mon, 11 Jan 2016 14:38:05 GMT; Path=/; Domain=okcupid.com; HttpOnly
Set-Cookie: session=15164195640309907921%3a17166043796188890290; Expires=Mon, 11 Jan 2016 14:38:05 GMT; Path=/; Domain=okcupid.com; HttpOnly
Set-Cookie: guest=; Expires=Sat, 10 Jan 2015 14:38:05 GMT; Path=/; Domain=okcupid.com; HttpOnly

HttpOnly cookies mitigate the impact, but anyway this is a stored XSS.

I see the following ways to fix this issue:
- encode HTML entities before a message is printed out
- remove any HTML code before a message is printed out (like it is implemented on "Messages" section)
