Summary:

Hi, 
there is a xss vulnerability and open redirect vulnerability in the return_url parameter for the following component:
http://youthvoices.adobe.com/community?return_url=
If a users tries to register or login after following this url:
http://youthvoices.adobe.com/community?return_url=javascript:alert(1)
http://youthvoices.adobe.com/community?return_url=//www.google.com
he will be redirected to google or will trigger the xss vulnerability.

Please see the poc videos below:

I would use this vulnerability to steal users session tokens or to redirect them to a fake login page where i could steal their passwords.
Please let me know what if you think and if you need more details

Kind regards,
