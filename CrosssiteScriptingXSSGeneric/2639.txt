Summary:

Hi,

This is a little tricky one.

First of all go to your profile page and change your name to "><img src=x onerror=prompt(12);>
Save it.
Wait!!! You will not see a javascript pop up there because there is proper input validation on the profile page.

Now to see the prompt box

1) Go to this link  https://sehacure.slack.com/help/requests/new
2) Add a new ticket. Now submit it. 
3) Now view your ticket.You will now be shown a prompt box.
4) Please have a look at the attached screenshot the inputs are not validated over there.

I have changed my name to }') ">ppp>
and i am attaching the source code view of the same.No, input encoding is done there.

Please have a check.

Best,
Anand
