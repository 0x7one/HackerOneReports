Summary:

Hi,

I opened this report as soon as I have read https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/

It doesn't necessarly affect HackerOne, nor have i given it enough time to get a working dom manipulation.
But since Markdown allows creating **target** attributes to anchor tags, it may be possible to get this executed. even if it doesn't, I think you shouldn't let users set the target=_blank attribute to their links. I reported this because I know (and have read similar reportes where) hackerone cares about even the slightest possiblites of this kinds of bugs existing

Markdown can create them using:
```
[link](url){:target="_blank"}
```

Thanks,
Paulos
