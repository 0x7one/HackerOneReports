Summary:
The way browsers handle SVG files is terrible. If you're serving SVG files that your users can upload, **only allow them to be served as `text/plain`**.
Hi , 

Background 
------------------------------------

I had problem in setup the airship at ubuntu so I tested on your site .  
If you uploads any file thet can use for XSS (HTML,SWF,etc) the content type will change to "text/plain; charset=us-ascii" . But for images it will stay the same . so if you upload SVG with JS content it will work fine ! 

The "Content-Type: image/svg+xml; charset=us-ascii" header will make this attack works . 

Just upload the svg file to the site .

SVG's  is not good sometimes to view as image and it will be stored in users accounts.

Thanks
