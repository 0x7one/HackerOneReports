Summary:

I noticed BIME is primarily built on Amazon AWS, which spawned my interest. I started looking for DNS entries that were still pointing to S3 buckets that however no longer exist. It appears this was the case for `a2.bime.io`, which points to an Amazon S3 website bucket in the US East region. 

# Steps to Reproduce
- Resolve `a2.bime.io` and see what is behind it:

```
michiel@msp ~ $ dig A a2.bime.io @8.8.8.8                                                                                                [2.1.8]

- It points to an Amazon S3 bucket in the S3 US East 1 region. Visiting http://a2.bime.io revealed that the bucket did not exist (a 404 error was shown). Obviously this is not the case any longer, as the bucket is now claimed and serving a fake login page (see "Attack Scenario").
- I created a bucket with name "a2.bime.io" on my S3 account in the US East 1 region.
- I enabled static website hosting and pointed "index.html" as the index document.
- Then I uploaded `index.html` (attached to this report) and clicked "Make public" to make sure it can be served. 
- Now go to http://a2.bime.io and you will see a BIME login page. Click the Sign In button and you will notice it is a fake login form. 

# Attack Scenario 
I created a false login page and posted it on http://a2.bime.io. The login page looks just like the normal BIME sign in page, but it is 100% controlled by the attacker. The attacker could harvest logins by convincing their victims to visit the fake login page. Since it is a subdomain of `bime.io`, which BIME customers will recognize, it is likely they will fall for the attack. 

I have attached the fake login page here as `index.html`.

# Remediation
Remove the `a2.bime.io` DNS entry so it no longer points to an S3 bucket Zendesk Ops doesn't control. If you need me to release `a2.bime.io` as an S3 bucket, let me know and I'll delete the bucket.
