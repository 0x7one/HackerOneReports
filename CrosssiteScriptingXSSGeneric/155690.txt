Summary:

Hi team

First I think this vulnerability doesn't fall at your bug bounty program but this is a bad design that should fix right now cause if an attacker get admin access he still can upload a malicious file in client server side.

I saw that Logo & Log in image allow to upload other files type example *.html and it'll execute in client server.
Other case,I created an html code and saved it as image file,server still executed it as html file.
The Logo & Log in image will upload it into ../data/themedinstancelogo & ../data/themedbackgroundlogo

Good news,I tried to upload an php file but server executed that file as text.

PoC:
Upload an html file through logo upload and Log in image and you will see that file will execute.
