WeaknessName:Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic
Reporter:https://hackerone.com/fransrosen
ReportedTo:Nextcloud(nextcloud)
BountyAmount:750.0
Severity:
State:Closed
DateOfDisclosure:19.07.2016 12:51:26

Summary:
Due to a recent migration of the Gallery app to the new sharing endpoint a parameter changed from an integer to a string value. This value wasn't sanitized before and was thus now vulnerable to a Cross-Site-Scripting attack.

To exploit this vulnerability an authenticated attacker has to share a folder with someone else, get them to open the shared folder in the Gallery app and open the sharing window there.

Since Nextcloud employes a strict Content-Security-Policy this vulnerability is only exploitable in browsers not supporting Content-Security-Policy. You can check at caniuse.com whether your browser supports CSP.

A detailed advisory can be found at https://nextcloud.com/security/advisory/?id=nc-sa-2016-001.

Thanks a lot, @fransrosen for pointing out this regression!
Hi,
Nice with the program launch! Congrats!

I noticed that there was a Share-icon when toggling to the Gallery-view of a directory under "Nextcloud Files":
{F99938}

If your directory has a malicious name such as a HTML-payload: `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`, this HTML will run when clicking on the Share-icon:
{F99937}

I see that you have a proper CSP in place, but remember that Internet Explorer is not there yet:
{F99939}

Also, since any user could create files, a user could potentially execute this for an admin (if that admin is not using a CSP-supported browser that is).

Let me know if you need more information.

Regards,
Frans
