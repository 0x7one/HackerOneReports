Summary:

Hi,
I see you have just launched the program on HackerOne.
And I have visited your site olx.com.ar and found an interesting XSS.

Let's see.
**Summary**
The bug lies in the 'description' of any posting. It seems you're removing and `<` and `>` sign to prevent including any html tags but there are some other ways ;-). I found that the `<meta>` tag is including everything from description.

**Steps to reproduce**
Go to https://www.olx.com.ar/posting
Now create an ad with everything you want.
In description put the following `;url=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgneHNzIGJ5IHphd2FkJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4="HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" blah="`
Now Publish the ad.
and Visit the ad. You will see XSS being triggered.

**PoC**

Hope you fix it  and offer some rewards :-)
