Summary:

Hi.  
  
Sorry for taking the time with this report.  
  
This is already publicly disclosed issue at -[https://github.com/makeusabrew/bootbox/issues/661](https://github.com/makeusabrew/bootbox/issues/661)  
  
In essence all dialogs of bootbox vulnurable to XSS injections ( bootbox.alert("\<script\>alert(1);\</script\>"); )  

This is apparently a feature to allow injecting HTML in messages but it is not very clear from the documentation.  
Even though this issue has been reported for a while no changes were made to fix this issue or even update the documentation

Kind Regards,  
Yoni

## Impact

Websites using bootbox to display messages containing user input are vulnerable to XSS
