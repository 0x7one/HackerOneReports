Summary:

Hello.

I found stored XSS in concrete5 5.7.0.4.

If the user have file upload permission
the user can upload the file named like 
"><svg onload=confirm(document.cookie)>.txt
and the file name is displayed without being escaped.

and when other user access the file manager page,
Execute Javascript code on page load.

Regards.
