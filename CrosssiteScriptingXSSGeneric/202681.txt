Summary:

Hello. First of all I wish you good luck securing your site, as far as I can tell, your site is secured, and this bug is minor.
It affects the content type header, when a file with an invalid content-type is uploaded, the value of the content-type file header is echoed back without any filtering.
You can see it here (Screenshot_5.png which I attached).
In addition, the full request I used to carry the XSS is also attached.
Any user can tamper with the mime type, it is of course a low servity bug and I doubt someone will ever exploit it, but I just want to make your webapp perfect =)
Good luck and waiting for further reply. ;)
