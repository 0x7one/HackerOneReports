WeaknessName:Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic
Reporter:https://hackerone.com/akhil-reni
ReportedTo:Twitter(twitter)

Severity:
State:Closed

Summary:

**Hello**

Group names in tweetdeck.twitter.com aren't filtered properly, giving scope for Cross site vulnerability attacks.
Challenge I have faced while escalating the xss:
- group name can only be 9 character long.

How i bypassed it:
Set multiple group names with different payloads, which means we can craft a good lengthy xss exploit using multiple group names.

Steps to reproduce:
- Create a Twitter DM group on twitter.com with group name ``<script>alert(1);//``
- go to https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/ to trigger the xss

Exploitation:
Group names can be changed by any user in the group
you can invite any user to https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/

Screenshot attached.

Environment : 
Works on all modern browsers
