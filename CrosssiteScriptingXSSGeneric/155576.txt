Summary:

Hello , i found a Cross-Site-Scripting in your github subdomain.
All you have to do is to search in this input ( i attached input.PNG )

Search about ,,document domain'' 
Alert was executed , because you don't sanitize the query which comes from github 

Search about ,,svg onload'' -> github.algolia.com


Thanks.
