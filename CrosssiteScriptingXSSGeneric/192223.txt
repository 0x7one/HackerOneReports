Summary:

Just like in the XSS vulnerability on Image parser, there is the same vulnerability on Audio (https://github.com/discourse/onebox/blob/394409ca319cc1a1cd31fefa50c9468c990531a3/lib/onebox/engine/audio_onebox.rb) and Video (https://github.com/discourse/onebox/blob/394409ca319cc1a1cd31fefa50c9468c990531a3/lib/onebox/engine/video_onebox.rb) parsers.

A malicious user can include a "fake" audio or video URL with a ' character, allowing him to execute Javascript code. 

Audio URL example: http://host/path'onerror=alert(1);//k.mp3
Video URL example: http://host/path'onerror=alert(1);//k.mp4

Ask me if you need more info to reproduce the vulnerability.
