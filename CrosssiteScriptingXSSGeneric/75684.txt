Summary:

Hello Security Team,
I Have Found A Stored XSS Vulnerability in [iPad Settings Page](https://dashboard.envoy.co/settings/ipad) ..
So .. Here Is How To Reproduce The Vulnerability:

1. Login To Your Account In Envoy 
2. Change Your Company Name From [Settings Page](https://dashboard.envoy.co/settings/account) .. And Set It To Your Payload Like `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>`. Or You Can Create A New Account With This Company Name.
3. Go To [iPad Settings Page](https://dashboard.envoy.co/settings/ipad) .. And Scroll Down To The **Signed Agreements** Section iPad Simulator
4. In The **Edit** Tap .. Insert The Predefined Variable `::COMPANY::` Which Show The   Company Name
5. Now .. Switch To The **Preview** Tap .. And Your Payload Will Be Excuted :))

And I Also Think The Payload Will Be Excuted On The iPad .. But I Didn't Test This.

If You Need More Information .. Just Ask.

Hope You Take a Look To My Other Report [#75676](https://hackerone.com/reports/75676) .

Cheers,
Ebram Marzouk
