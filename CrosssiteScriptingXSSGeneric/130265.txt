Summary:
This issue, an XSS vulnerability caused by a WordPress module ([Easy Social Share Button](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-social-share-buttons/)) could have affected users running browsers without any XSS filtering (e.g. Firefox)

The issue had been previously reported to us and resolved (by manually patching the module), but the patch was recently reverted when changing to a different version of the module.

While issues with blog.trello.com are often not in scope for our program, and this would not have directly compromised user data, we did (re-)resolve this issue and chose to award a bounty.
