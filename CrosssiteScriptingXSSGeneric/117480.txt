WeaknessName:Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic
Reporter:https://hackerone.com/albinowax

Summary:

developer.zendesk.com is vulnerable to stored XSS via Angular template injection.

To replicate:
Browse to https://developer.zendesk.com
Sign up with an arbitrary email address and the following name: "{{'a'.constructor.prototype.charAt=[].join;$eval('x=alert(1)');}}"
Observe the popup. 

This is a stored vulnerability - every time that user views https://developer.zendesk.com/account it will hit them.

This is not self-xss - it's possible to exploit other users by using the intentional XSS on freetrial.zendesk.com to inject a cookie into other users' browsers, forcibly logging them into my account. 


Client-side template injection vulnerabilities arise when applications using a client-side template framework dynamically embed user input in web pages. When a web page is rendered, the framework will scan the page for template expressions, and execute any that it encounters. An attacker can exploit this by supplying a malicious template expression that launches a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

If possible, avoid using server-side code to dynamically embed user input into client-side templates. You can prevent angular from executing expressions in blocks of HTML by using the ng-non-bindable directive: https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngNonBindable If this is not practical, consider filtering out { and } from user input. Upgrading to Angular 1.5 will prevent this particular sandbox escape from working, but is not a robust fix as Angular maintain that the sandbox isn't a security feature and can't be trusted - see https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/nonvuln/angularjs-expression-sandbox-bypass
