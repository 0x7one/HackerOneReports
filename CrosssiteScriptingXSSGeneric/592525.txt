## Vulnerability Description

> Description about how the vulnerability was found and how it can be exploited, how it harms package users (data modification/lost, system access, other.

I expected that calls to react-autolinker-wrapper would find urls, etc. within text and convert them to anchor tags, but I discovered that script execution occurs instead. 

## Steps To Reproduce:

Below is a vulnerable example of using react-autolinker-wrapper to convert user input into anchor tags. If one inserts `<img src=x onerror=alert() >` into the input area then XSS occurs. 

```
import React from 'react';
import AutolinkerWrapper from 'react-autolinker-wrapper'

class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(){
    super()
    this.state = {text: "fudge"}
    this.changeState = this.changeState.bind(this)
  }

  changeState(event){
    this.setState({text: event.target.value})
  }

  render(){
    return (
    <div className="App">
     <input placeholder="Place your link here" type="text" onChange={this.changeState}/>
     <AutolinkerWrapper text={this.state.text}/>
    </div>)
  }
}

export default App;
```
