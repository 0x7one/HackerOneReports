Summary:

Hello Team,

I have found a reflected XSS on Signup Page i.e. on https://newrelic.com/signup. Please find the below details.

Vulnerable URL: https://newrelic.com/signup

Vulnerable Field: Your Email Address

Vulnerable Parameter: email

Parameter Type: POST

Payload used: <img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>

Browser used: Mozilla Firefox v44.0.2

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Go to https://newrelic.com/signup
2. Just fill up the signup form and don't submit.
3. Open burp suite and configure it to intercept the submit request.
4. Submit the form.
5. Change the value of email parameter from a valid email address to <img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>
6. Forward the request and turn intercept off.
7. Go to browser and Tadaa! XSS Triggers.

Regarding exploitation:

This form throws an error that "[EMAIL ADDRESS]: email doesn't appear to be a valid email address" where [EMAIL ADDRESS] is actually <img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>.

I tried the same by changing value of authenticity_token by 1 character and same error occurred. Thus, a pre-populated form can be sent to a victim to exploit this post based XSS.

Proof of Concept: Please find the attached screenshot.

Best Regards,
