WeaknessName:Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic
Reporter:https://hackerone.com/virtualhunter
ReportedTo:Zendesk(zendesk)
BountyAmount:100.0
Severity:
State:Closed
DateOfDisclosure:15.12.2016 0:56:43

Summary:

Vulnerable urls:
https://www.zendesk.com/product/tour/
https://www.zendesk.com/product/pricing/
or just https://www.zendesk.com/product/

Vulnerable parameter is a **cvo_sid1**, used in **live.js**  to call convertro code (without sanitizing). This leads to generating malformed javascript answer with XSS injection ability. (See screenshots below).
There is a restriction on a semicolon use, so i replaced it with %3b.

To reproduce vulnerability, you could try this safe example:
`https://www.zendesk.com/product/tour/#?cvo_sid1=1")%3balert(document.cookie%2b"`

This vulnerability provides a great opportunity for victim to lose not only cookies, but also control over the account after stealth forwarding to porposely generated link like this :))
