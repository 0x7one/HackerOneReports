Hi,i have found an stored xss which is reflected at https://www.algolia.com/explorer#?index=getstarted_actors&tab=explorer

Steps to produce:
1) Go to https://www.algolia.com/explorer#?index=getstarted_actors&tab=explorer and add "><img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie);> as an attribute and keep it at top as in screenshot1

2) Go to  https://www.algolia.com/explorer#?index=getstarted_actors&tab=ranking and take the cursor on the ranking info(the trophy icon),and you will see a pop up alert of xss. (Screenshot2)
 I have tested it on Chrome and firefox its works on both.
