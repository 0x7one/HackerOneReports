Reporter:https://hackerone.com/akhil-reni

Summary:

**hello**,

Let's say a shop has a checkout button.
when we click buy now , you will be redirected to https://madamcury.myshopify.com/cart/1188733065:1?channel=buy_button&referer=javascript:alert(document.cookie);

Keep an eye on referer parameter in URL 
`referer=javascript:alert(document.cookie);`

A customer can set referer to a xss payload, and the admin will see a referer parameter in his control panel, if the admin clicks on the link the xss triggered. (POC ATTACHED)

Steps to reproduce
==================================
- create a buy now button
- when you click buy now button , you will be redirected to https://madamcury.myshopify.com/cart/1188733065:1?channel=buy_button&referer=javascript:alert(document.cookie);
- set referer parameter in url to javascript:alert(document.cookie);
- finish the order
- now from admin account login into admin panel,
- click the referer link , you will see a xss triggered.

All admins, users of a shop can be targeted with this attack.
Tell me if you any issues reproducing the issue :)
