Summary:

Dear Ubiquiti Networks bug bounty team,

# Short Description
---

scores.ubnt.com is still vulnerable to reflected XSS, a form of client-side code injection wherein one can execute malicious scripts into a page. The fix to https://hackerone.com/reports/158484 does not suffice for some browsers (mainly older versions) since there are `style` attribute XSS vectors.

# Why does this vulnerability exist?
---

Cross-site scripting exists whenever input can be interpreted as code. Scripts can be injected into the `style` attribute via the `p` parameter as follows:

https://scores.ubnt.com/form.html?uid=259&p=airFiber);xss:expression(alert(1));border-image:url(foobar

Here are a list of payloads:

~~~
);xss:expression(alert(1));border-image:url(foobar
);border-image: url(javascript:alert(1));content:url(foobar
~~~

# What are the exploits?
---

A cross-site scripting vulnerability allows an attacker to modify the page. This means he/she can inject forms to steal usernames, passwords, cookies (no HttpOnly flag present) and so forth. In short, XSS opens the doors to plenty of phishing techniques.
