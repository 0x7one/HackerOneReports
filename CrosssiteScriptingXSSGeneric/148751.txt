Summary:
This one was a grey area. One one hand, it's literally stored and it's literally a Javascript payload that a user could accidentally execute. On the other hand, it pushes the envelope of what counts as a vulnerability or not. (We decided to award a bounty as per our stated policy to err on the side of generosity when in doubt.) That being said, there's no real world use-case for a guest to share a non-HTTP(S) URL in their attribution for blog comments.
Comments can contain an author's website. This website is used in the href attribute of link elements and isn't filtered. Thus it allows URLs like `javascript:alert(1)` to be used. These URLs must be filtered by protocol, e.g. only allow http and https.

These attacks are blocked by the default CSP, but clients not supporting CSP or changed CSPs may be affected.

This issue affects [Airship](https://github.com/paragonie/airship) Version 1.1.2 and lower.
