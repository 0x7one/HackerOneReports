Reporter:https://hackerone.com/virtualhunter

Summary:

This is stored vulnerability for all your users, not only registered or signed in.

Vulnerable parameter: properties[builder_id] at *.shopify.com/cart/add
The vulnerability is in array levels. When you try something like 
properties[builder_id][second_parameter]=value,
you will see many corrupted tags in HTML because 2-level array will return as 
"builder_id":{"second_parameter ":"value"} instead of "builder_id":"shapp_options_421549285_1455208671885" in cart.js

So you could inject your code in tr,div,a,insert  tags. All you need - is redirect a victim to special url. For example, you cold try this: properties[builder_id][%20onmouseover%3dalert(1)%20]=value 
Script will strike when victim will move a coursor over product.
