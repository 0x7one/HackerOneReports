Summary:

Hi,

While experimenting with parser bypass techniques, I discovered that reStructuredText markup can be used to inject a stored JavaScript payload into a project `README.rst` file.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a new GitLab project
2. Initialise the project by creating a `README` file
3. Set the file title to `README.rst`
4. Paste the below Payload into the file
5. Commit the file to the project and click on the link

## Proof of Concept Payload

```
`Security test link`__.

__ javascript:alert(document.domain)
```

Thanks!
