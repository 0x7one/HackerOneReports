Summary:

Hi,

There is improper validation at q parameter on https://m.olx.ph/ where it can be manipulated by an attacker to include his/her XSS payload to execute javascript code.

As example:

``https://m.olx.ph/all-results?q=0;url=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgndGVzdDMnKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg" HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" a="a``

Where once opened the above URL, once refreshed, a Javascript popup will appear.
This is because, from the XSS payload used, the Meta tag was properly closed with " character and then it was supplied with a redirect script which already encoded in Base64 format. Where if decoded, it is actually 
``<script>alert('test3')</script>``
