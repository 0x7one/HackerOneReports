Summary:

Reproduction:

- Create a new private project
- Log in as another user and go the the newly create project page. Request access there.
- Switch back to original user and check pending requests.
- At this point I was able to assign a non-existing role (I changed the dropdown list and chose 10 as value). Grant user access then.
- Log in again a the user that requested access. The dashboard indicates that the request was accepted. 
- Click on the project. The following error is given:
