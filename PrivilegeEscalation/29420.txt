Summary:

An attacker can update the subscription details of the victim without any action from the victim. Following are the steps to reproduce:

1. Login into account with any set of credentials, say victim@gmail.com 
2. Click on "Create an Account", Click on Organization, Fill in all the details. Complete the next step too. Go to home. 
3. Click on "Plus" sign in front of "Subscribers"
4. FIll in plan name, price and other details. Save It. 
5. Click on Edit Icon, Change the details and Intercept the request. 
6. Note the value of "subscription_plan_id" parameter. This should be same as the last digit in the URL. 

7. Login into the application with another set of credentials, say attacker@gmail.com.
8. Repeat steps from "step 2" to "step 5". Make sure you fill in other details.
9. Change the values to whatever you want to change in victim's account. Now change the value of "subscription_plan_id" from your subscription id to the one copied earlier in step 6. 
10. Forward the request. You will see that the changes reflect in the victim's account, and not your account.

Note: As subscription_plan_id is a numeric code, this can be simply brute forced and details of any subscriptions can be changed. Also the subscription details include some money stuff, so it Sounds problematic.
