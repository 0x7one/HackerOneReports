Summary:

There is a misconfigured wordpress installation at yelpblog.com, through which i am able to download any php files in wp-includes folder.

For a PoC, you can open https://www.yelpblog.com/wp-includes/wp-db.php, and the wp-db.php will be download(along with all the data in it)

As we all know that these PHP files can sensative information of a website, and the wp-includes folder is the base of a WordPress installation, Being able to download php files is a clearly wrong behaviour of a wordpress installation.
The PHP files in wp-includes can have a lot of sensative information about the server, which may help a attacker in compromising the server. He can even do a source code analysis if he is able to download arbitrary 
PHP files.
