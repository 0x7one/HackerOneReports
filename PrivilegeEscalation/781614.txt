Summary:

The subdomain status-stage0.stripo.email was pointed at uptimerobot.com
whereas it was not being used , but having Cname record as stats.uptimerobot.com .
Hence anyone can takeover it.

I have parked it with an account on uptimerobot.com
note : 
this issue is similar to [report](https://hackerone.com/reports/737695)
but with another subdomain

## Impact

Subdomain takeover can be abused to do several things like :

Malware distribution
Phishing / Spear phishing
XSS
Authentication bypass
Legitimate mail sending and receiving on behalf of ford subdomain
...
List goes on and on
