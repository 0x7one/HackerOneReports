# Vulnerability Overview
When Burpsuite runs, it tries to load some DLLs in the path ```C:\Program%20Files```. Because the folder doesn't exists, it can be created **by a low-privileged user** which can inject arbitrary DLL into the process when another ** privileged user** runs Burpsuite. I have verified the vulnerability in the Pro Version but I'm pretty sure the community version is also affected.

# Vulnerability Description
Monitoring the BurpSuite application in Process Monitor, we can see that it tries to load 2 DLLs from a directory that does not exist.
{F375743}

The interesting thing here is, that on Windows (verified for 7,10,Server 2008 R2 and Server 2012) every authenticated user is allowed to add new folders on the ```C:\``` drive. This in turn allows an attacker to create the folder structure and inject arbitrary DLLs to Burpsuite.

# Vulnerability Reproduction Steps
1. Login as a low-privileged user on a system which has Burpsuite installed.

2. Create the directory tree as shown in the image below.

3. Copy the attached ```sunec.dll``` file to the last directory (amd64).
4. Simulate the login of a privileged user , run Burpsuite and a message should pop up.

## Impact

A low privileged user can execute code as a high privileged user.
