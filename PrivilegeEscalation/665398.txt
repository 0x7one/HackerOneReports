Summary:

**Summary:**
The subdomain datacafe-cert.starbucks.com had an CNAME record pointing to an unclaimed Azure webservice. This is a high severity security issue because an attacker can register the subdomain on Azure and therefore can own the subdomain datacafe-cert.starbucks.com.

**Description:**
The dangling CNAME record of datacafe-cert.starbucks.com is pointing to s00397nasv101-datacafe-cert.azurewebsites.net which was not claimed by you. I registered a service with this name and therefore was able to takeover the subdomain. Every attacker doing this has afterwords full control over the contents served on this subdomain.

**Platform(s) Affected:** 
http://datacafe-cert.starbucks.com/
https://datacafe-cert.starbucks.com/
