2. Login as Bob and create an album (say, BobAlbum with album id 3295969). 
3. From Bob, navigate to the AliceVideo URL - https://vimeo.com/118026546. Click collections and add video to BobAlbum.
4. Navigate to BobAlbum and click the AliceVideo. The URL will looks like, https://vimeo.com/album/3295969/video/118026546

6. From Alice account, make AliceVideo as private (check 'only me'->'apply to all existing videos' setting).

7. From Bob account, access the AliceVideo URL (https://vimeo.com/album/3295969/video/118026546) and it displays 'permssion denied' message. At this point, Bob can't view the video or leave comments. However, Bob can post comments on the private video by replaying the request captured in step 5.
