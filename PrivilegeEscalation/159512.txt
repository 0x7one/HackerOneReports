Summary:
@troubleshooter identified a discrepancy between our frontend and backend validation. While our frontend did not allow hackers to request mediation on reports that were too old to mediate, a forged request would still be accepted by our backend due to different validation rules. While this has minor security implications, we decided to make the validations consistent and award our minimum bounty of $500 here.
Hi Hackerone Team,

it is possible to request mediation for reports, that have the closedTooLongToMediate-parameter set to true,
by requesting a mediation for a new report and changing the report id to the old report.
