Summary:

When we try to open a private folder http://download.newrelic.com/private/ we get a warning:

> This directory contains special-access versions of the New Relic agents.
If you would like to participate in early access or beta testing programs please
contact support@newrelic.com and they will forward your request to the
program managers.

However there's a way to gain access there without request: there's a file called [junk](http://download.newrelic.com/junk) in the root directory (sometimes when you open http://download.newrelic.com it doesn't exist â€” try again if so until it appears, see the attachement). It contains all the server paths, including the private ones, for example

> ./private/282bd32f9a/pub/newrelic-testing

We can simply open it

> http://download.newrelic.com/private/282bd32f9a/pub/newrelic-testing

and get the stuff we need from there.
