Summary:

Hello team!

I've found a privilege escalation issue which allows to set iframes to the projects w/o upgrading.

### Steps to reproduce
- Login
- Navigate to the project
- Choose `integrations` and click the `IFrame`
- See that you'll get `upgrade now` notification
{F501019}
- Inspect the page with developer tool and choose the `upgrade` from `IFrame` icon
- Delete the `data-upgrade="true"` part
{F501023}
- Click the `IFrame` and see that you are able to add iframe to the page w/o upgrade
{F501024}


If you need any information please let me know.

Cheers!
