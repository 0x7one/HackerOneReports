Summary:

Hi Team,

Description : In Timesheet you have option for submitting your expense for the projects you are assigned. But Only Admin can view other user's Expenses and related receipts. But there is a request which gives a full size of expense receipt attached to the expenses. This request is vulnerable to IDOR attack and any user can view any other user's receipts by changing the ID.

POC : 
Vulnerable link :
https://[Company_username].harvestapp.com/expenses/[Receipt_ID]/receipt

Change the receipt ID which exist in the company and you will be able to see the expense receipt submitted by any user in the company.

Let me know if you need any other help from my side.

Best Regards !
Vijay Kumar
