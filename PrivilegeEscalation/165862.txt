Hey team,
there is an IDOR bug, which allows me to add an invoice to any retainer I wish, even if the retainer belongs to another app/subdomain.

Steps to reproduce
---------
1. Make sure you have two apps __A__ and **B**
2. In **A** create a retainer, let's say it has id `1234`.
3. In **B** open this link:
    https://SUBDOMAIN.harvestapp.com/invoices/new?invoice[client_id]=5678&invoice[kind]=retainer&invoice[retainer_id]=1234


    Here _5678_ needs to be a valid client id for account **B**. Then simply fill out the invoice form and save it.

4. Now in account **A** go to `https://[SUBDOMAIN].harvestapp.com/retainers/1234` and you will see that the invoice from account **B** was added to this retainer.
