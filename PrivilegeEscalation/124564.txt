Summary:
Missing rate limit on password protected clips.

Rate-limits is a non-qualifying bug at this time. 

We have received multiple reports of this in the past, however, since that time we have implemented a clip password rate limit. 

This was not appropriately applied to all clip password areas, so we've decided to award reputation points for pointing this particular issue out.
