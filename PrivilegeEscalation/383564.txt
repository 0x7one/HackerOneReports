Summary:

Hello,

This is fairly close to [this report](https://hackerone.com/reports/325336) however these are different subdomains than the one in the report.

This can be pretty serious since I can server virtually anything I want. In the 45 minutes I've held the domain I have served to 341 unique IP addresses. 

Two starbucks.com subdomains are pointed to Azure with an unclaimed CNAME record. Anyone would be able to serve content on these subdomains.

#PoC:
http://svcgatewayloadus.starbucks.com/
http://svcgatewaydevus.starbucks.com/

##Mitigation:
Remove the CNAME record from the starbucks.com DNS zone
Claim it in Azure once I release it

## Impact

Subdomain takeover can be used for several purposes:

* Malware
* Phishing / Spear phishing
* XSS
* Authentication bypass
