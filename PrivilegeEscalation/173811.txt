Summary:

Hi, I've found .git repository available on http://████/.git/
Using https://github.com/kost/dvcs-ripper you can download source files, even if directory listing is forbidden.
I've managed to download some object files from repository. 
One of them http://██████████/.git/objects/db/23e27c516300223034936a7cf274906f6a78f1 contains WP config with CRITICAL sensitive data, including your DB username and PASS.
define('DB_NAME', '██████████');

/* MySQL database username /
define('DB_USER', '██████');

/* MySQL database password /
define('DB_PASSWORD', '████████');

/* MySQL hostname /
define('DB_HOST', '██████');
