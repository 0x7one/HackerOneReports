Summary:
nukedx discovered that the mail.starbucks.bg domain was pointing to a mail service from icn.bg and confirmed that icn.bg did not host this domain. nukedx successfully claimed the subdomain from icn.bg, configured login credentials through the web panel and setup a valid email server. nukedx then sent a successful test from an @mail.starbucks.bg email address as a valid POC.

@nukedx â€” thank you for reporting this vulnerability and confirming the resolution.
