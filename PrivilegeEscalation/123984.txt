Summary:
When a user is a member of a team, they are allowed to connect to an update channel that sends them notifications when the team changes.

There were some cases where a team member might receive an update that included the name of board that was in their team â€¦ even if they weren't a member of that board, and wouldn't otherwise have permission to see the board.  (This was limited to the updates that were sent when a private board was added to or removed from a team)

Additionally, the update channel was not immediately terminated when a user was removed from a team.  This meant that a user could theoretically connect an update channel while they were a member of a team, and continue to receive updates on it after being removed.
