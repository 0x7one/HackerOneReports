Summary:

Hello Team,

I have found a critical IDOR for deleting any groups of any organization remotely. It means an attacker can easily delete any group of any organization from his account by just chaning the group_id in delete request.

This is similar to previously reported IDOR to delete any members. So I am not writing down steps to reproduce again as it is also similar but jut to perform in Groups section.

Proof of Concept: Please find the attached screenshots.

Do evaluate it and inform me accordingly.

Best Regards,

Hely H. Shah
