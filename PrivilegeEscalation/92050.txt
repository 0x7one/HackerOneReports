Summary:
If a team was **already significantly compromised** because an attacker had gained control of an account that was part of the team, they could use the API to add a new member to the team with equivalent permissions to the account they had already compromised.

While this wouldn't give an attacker any **additional** access to the team (beyond what they'd already have with the they'd already compromised), this behavior was unintended.

A normal user does not have privilege to add new members to a group. But adding following HTML button (Payload), a Normal user can add new members to a group which he did not have privilege to perform
Payload: 
<a class="button-link u-gutter js-manage-members" href="#"><span class="icon-sm icon-member"></span> Add Members</a>

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Login to Trello  https://trello.com/login
2. Navigate to any team Members page for which you are a normal user
3. Add the above HTML element in the page by using Developer's tool as shown in PoC video
4. Click on the above added button
5. Give an Email address who is not a trello user
6. Click on Send button

Result: A forbidden Message is displayed by trello. But refresh the page and see that the new member is added to the group by a low privilege trello user who did not have the privilege to add members to group.

Please refer the following PoC video for steps and proof.
