Summary:

Something Interesting happening here !! ;)

Steps to reproduce :

1) Suppose User1 have Public Project called http://www.localize.io/v/8h
2) In public project any other user ll not have permissions to edit project 
3) Now User2 want to make a group in http://www.localize.io/v/8h which is unlikely not possible .
4) Soo what now ?? :P
5) User2 ll go to his any own project and edit the project like (http://www.localize.io/pages/create_project/3F) and he ll create a new group there , while creating the new group intercept the request and change it with http://www.localize.io/v/8h
6) Bang !! The group ll be created on User1 side .

Request (From User2 side) :

POST /pages/create_project/3F HTTP/1.1
