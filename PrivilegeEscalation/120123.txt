Summary:

Hello Team,

I have found a critical IDOR issue which escalates a user privilege and allows and attacker to delete any venue of any organization remotely through his own account by just changing the venue id in DELETE Request.

This is again similar to previously reported critical IDORs to delete a member and group. Thus, I am not writing steps again as they are same but just to perform under venue section.

Proof of Concept: Please find the attached screenshots.

Best Regards,
