Summary:
An issue where any user could enable Google Apps integration, and allow anyone from a custom Google Apps Domain to login in the store via OAuth. The issue could only be triggered by a logged-in staff member of the store, but this feature should be available to the store owner only.
 'Login services' section in the Settings->Account is accessible only to the Account owners. However, shop admins (full access users) can escalate privileges and modify the login services.

To verify,
1. Log into https://seclearn.myshopify.com as admin.
2. Navigate to settings->Account, notice that it does not show Login Services section to this user. However, he can modify the Login Services by sending the below request (use proper authenticity_token and cookies before sending the request).

	POST /admin/login_services/google_apps/update HTTP/1.1
	Host: seclearn.myshopify.com
	User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:37.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/37.0
	Cookie: ...

3. To confirm, log in as Account owner and look at the Login Services section. Notice that, Google apps are enabled and securitylearn.net is added to the google app domain.
