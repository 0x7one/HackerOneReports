Summary:
A Department of Defense website was vulnerable to an insecure direct object reference vulnerability (IDOR) which may allow an attacker to modify web content or certain database parameters. @uranium238 was able to demonstrate this vulnerability by manipulating web objects in a particular way. Very well done. Thank you!
