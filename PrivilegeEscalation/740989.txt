Summary:
@vulnh0lic noticed that a staff member without Apps permission was able to access the Stocky app. We determined that this was because of a bug in Stocky's OAuth authentication code, which allowed the user to be granted access to Stocky at the start of the OAuth process rather than the end. This resulted in a full authentication bypass. Within an hour of validating the report, we deployed a fix for this vulnerability.

After fixing the vulnerability, we analyzed our server logs and did not find any evidence that the authentication bypass had been exploited.
