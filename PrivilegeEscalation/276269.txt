Summary:
Hacker @benoculars was able to successfully faciliate multiple subdomain takeovers by taking advantage of a process flow to use some of the space provided for germany.openapi.starbucks.com, psv.openapi.starbucks.com, stage-psv.openapi.starbucks.com, and test-psv.openapi.starbucks.com. While we were still securely serving content from these domains, and no users or operations were impacted, it would have been possible for @benoculars to serve content from unique URLs not in use by our applications and services. 

@benoculars had illustrated a non-destructive PoC, showing his ability to serve content from our domain. We were able to make platform and operational changes to resolve this issue. 

Thanks @benocular for identifying weak subdomains and helping to resolve this issue! Great work!
