Summary:
##Issue

The reporter found that one error page that could be triggered had an outer "frame" that contained some administrative menus and a logoff-button. The menus were visible but as the user was not logged on, had no real functionality enabled. The logoff-button was mereley misinforming.

##Fix

The unnecessary items were removed from the error page.

##Reasoning

The issue was trivial, namely a confusing error page. The page was nevertheless decided to be fixed, and the reporter awarded with a bounty.
