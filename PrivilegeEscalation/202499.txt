Summary:

Hey, mongoose

When the owner of a chat room gives any user Viewing Privilege, that user can then send messages to the room. As expected, there's no form to send messages when the user access the room since in theory it shouldn't be possible. However, messages via POST requests can still be sent and processed.

The Severity of this issue is marked as low, but it still can be a serious problem depending on the scenario.

Steps to reproduce
====================

1. Create a new room
2. Give **only** Viewing Privilege to a user or all users
3. Send the following POST as the user with Viewing Privilege only
4. Refresh browser and see the message sent

```

```

This isn't session related since logging in and out doesn't affect anything. Just replace "X-Phabricator-Csrf" and "phsid" with the new ones and the message still will be sent.
