Summary:

Hello,

This time I found a IDOR(Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerability. It allows an attacker to get unauthorized access to `Videos` of Channel whose privacy is set to `Only moderators and people I choose` without being a member.
In simple words, we can access videos of private channel without being member of it.

Proof Of Concept:
===============
1. See this channel ---> https://vimeo.com/channels/870575
When opened it will show an error ---> 
`Private Channel
Sorry, this Channel is private. You do not have permission to view this Channel.`

2. Now, I have a video placed there. Follow the steps to get access to my video.

3.  Go to ---> https://vimeo.com/tools/widget/montage
(Use burp proxy and intercept the request mades.)

1st request --->  https://vimeo.com/tools/widget/montage
2nd request ---> `https://vimeo.com/tools/widget/montage?widget=1&preview=1&user_id=36807051&badge_stream=channel&badge_channel=870575&badge_album=3231945&badge_layout=horizontal&badge_quantity=6&show_titles=no&badge_size=80`
###Note `badge_channel` parameter to any value.

Open this link ---> https://vimeo.com/tools/widget/montage?widget=1&preview=1&user_id=36807051&badge_stream=channel&badge_channel=870575&badge_album=3231945&badge_layout=horizontal&badge_quantity=6&show_titles=no&badge_size=80

You will be shown my videos. Now keep enumerating `badge_channel={any valid value}`, it will get you access to any videos.

4. Game over ...! :D
5. This very dangerous as we can access any videos.


Video POC : ---> http://youtu.be/vRAtxovcfHs (It is an unlisted video on youtube.)

Hope to see this patched quickly. :-)
