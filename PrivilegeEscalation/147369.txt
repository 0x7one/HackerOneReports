Summary:

Found a super minor issue that allows a user to start a call in a channel of an unpaid account. Besides the minor financial incentive for an attacker, this doesn't have a super high impact. Wanted to let you know anyway since it's not possible through the UI by default. To reproce it, start by signing in to a user that is part of an unpaid account and start intercepting your network traffic (I used Burp Suite).

 - Go to a channel, in the top bar, you'll see that the Call feature is not available.

 - Go to a private chat window of another user
 - Intercept your network traffic and click the "Call" button in the top bar. The first request will be to https://account.slack.com/call/ID. Forward this request.
 - The next request will look like this:

```
POST /api/screenhero.rooms.create?_x_id=<ID> HTTP/1.1
Host: account.slack.com
...

 - Change the `channel` value to the ID of the a channel. This ID can be obtained by clicking on a channel in the left column and copy it from the WebSocket data being sent to Slack. Now forward the requests and stop intercepting traffic.
 - The call will be posted in the channel:
