Summary:

Hi there,

This is a vulnerability in Create and Update permission in drchrono. When you try to [modify a role of a certain staff member](https://trizaeron.drchrono.com/permissions/#staff) then uncheck Create and Update patients it supposed to barred your staff in updating users.

But this does not appear to be true. Yes a ``You do not have permission to access this page.`` error displays when you visit [https://trizaeron.drchrono.com/patients/](https://trizaeron.drchrono.com/patients/) but a direct access to a patient info does not! [https://trizaeron.drchrono.com/patients/56958243/?](https://trizaeron.drchrono.com/patients/56958243/?)

What this means, a staff can directly access still the patients and modify its details. 

In case you needed more information, kindly let me know.

Cheers
Clifford
