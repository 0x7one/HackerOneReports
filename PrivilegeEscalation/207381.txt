Summary:

Hi,

While conducting New Relic web property reconnaissance, I came across the unused **docs-ra.newrelic.com** endpoint.

This endpoint allowed an unauthenticated user to progress through the Drupal installation process and activate the site with their own configuration â€“ it appears that valid MySQL credentials have been pre-populated. 

{F161898}

Given that this site is publicly accessible, I have taken care to ensure the content currently being served is active in a discreet manner. As such, the current site (with successful takeover) can be viewed as follows:

{F161899}

### Credentials
Username: newrelic1
Password: `ibvmJqqsi9x[kRqe`

Please let me know if you require any additional information regarding this vulnerability, 

Thanks!
