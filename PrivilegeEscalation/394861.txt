Summary:

    if (!SetSecurityDescriptorDacl(&sdPipeDescriptor, TRUE, NULL, FALSE))
{

This was purely identified on code review, Never create NULL ACLs.

A mail was sent to security@mariadb.org and MariaDB team is working on this and a fix will be pushed in next version, attached mail headers for your reference.

## Impact

An attacker can set it to Everyone (Deny All  Access), which would even forbid administrator access and may lead to privilege escalation.
