Summary:
##Issue

The reporter found a flaw where it was possible to enumerate users in the unsubscribe -function on one of the apps on viestinta.lahitapiola.fi. 

##Fix

The issue was investigated and found to be valid. Anything differentiating a successful and an unsuccessful "unsubscription" was removed from the application.

##Reasoning

A user enumeration vulnerability means that an attacker can get a list of legal usernames and/or email addresses from the site. Using brute force, means that an attacker can use a list of potential usernames and/or email addresses with which they can verify whether or not each of them is registered with an account in the site.

As this application does not contain a customer register, but rather email-addresses with no direct connection to customers, the impact of the reported vulnerability is quite small.
Hi,
I would like to report an issue where malicious user can unsubscribe any customer email subscription from viestinta.lahitapiola.fi. 
I am not sure if this in scope, but i took the liberty to bring forward to you, so that you can fix the bug.

**Impact**
Subscribe or unsubscribe is always a personal/customer choice. but what if a malicious user unsubscribe without the knowledge/Authority of the valuable customer who would like to get a regular update from the company? What if an attacker unsubscribe ALL the customer email subscription? I assume finding valid email of customers would not be big deal for an Attacker.
Hence, this could impact company's business.  

**Step to reproduce**:
Goto
http://viestinta.lahitapiola.fi/webApp/omatalousuk?email=

in the ```email=``` param enter any email id
for example, enter```abcd123@gmail.com``` will get a respond ```No customer found, cannot unsubscribe```
for a vaild customer email, ```test@gmail.com``` will get a respond ```Unsubscribe```

with this, a malicious user would exploit this vulnerability.

I've attach some screen shot of execution.
Thank you.
