Summary:

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a new user and make him an admin of an arbitrary group
2. Log in as this new user
3. Create a new user "files_external", "appdata_{random-data}", ..
4. Delete this user

Result: The data/files_external / data/appdata{..} folder is removed.

Solution: Prevent creation of users if data/{new-user-uid} is either
a file or a folder. In addition, prevent deletion of users where the
user data directory (data/{user}) contains other files and folders
than "files" (where the user data is stored).

## Impact

Group admin can remove arbitrary data from "data" directory
