Summary:

**Target:**  `Landing.udemy.com`

###Details: 

The target subdomain points to _unbounce.com_ service, via a _DNS CNAME_ record. As a result of this, an attacker could potentially initiate a subdomain takeover by registering the subdomain on unbounce.com.

Additionally, 

Unbounce is a custom 404-page hosting service, therefore leveraging its functionality an attacker can host custom HTML/Javascript webpage on the domain which will look very legitimate to the end-user and can be used to conduct large-scale phishing/XSS attacks.

###Proof of Concept:

CNAME Record:
>**Cname:**	unbouncepages.com
>**Name:**	landing.udemy.com
>**Type:**  CNAME
>**Class:**	IN
>**TTL:**	300

I did not proceed with the takeover, Contacting the support and confirming from them was more sensible.

###Remediation:

Remove the CNAME entry or claim the domain by signing up on unbounce.com
