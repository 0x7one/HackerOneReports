Summary:

If you can make a group then why can't you delete the group :P 

With same method of creating the group you can delete the group 
But have some restrictions :/ :

1) in any project you ll not get to know the deleteGroup[id] 
2) May be I'm only one who is making groups now so i can assume the deleteGroup[id] like 96,97,98 :P
