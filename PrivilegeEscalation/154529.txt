Summary:

A logical bug in the bookmark app makes it possible to delete all the existing bookmarks of the user. 

Here are the steps to reproduce: 
- Create  couple of valid bookmarks
- Import a bookmark.html file that contains the line **<a href="">Bookmark</a>**. All the bookmarks of the user is replaced with blank url and Bookmark as description. 
- This is potentially a risk where a user could be sent malicious html file to delete the bookmarks or this could even happen unintentionally if the user uploads a html with blank urls. 

The logical flaw resides in the method **/apps/bookmarks/controller/lib/bookmarks.php** -> **addBookmark**  where SQL query will select all the bookmarks and update them.
