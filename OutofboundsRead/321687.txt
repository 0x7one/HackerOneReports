Summary:

I would like to report an uninitialized Buffer allocation issue in `base64url`.
It allows to extract sensitive data from uninitialized memory or to cause a DoS by passing in a large number, in setups where typed user input can be passed (e.g. from JSON), on Node.js 4.x and lower.

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

The problem arises when a number is passed in, e.g. from user-submitted JSON-encoded data.
The API should not propagate the already-bad Buffer issue further.

On Node.js 4.x and below (4.x is still supported), this exposes uninitialized memory, which could contain sensitive data. This can be also used to cause a DoS by consuming the memory when large numbers are passed on input.

## Steps To Reproduce:

`console.log(require('base64url').encode(1000))`  (note uninitialized memory in output)
`require('base64url').encode(1e8)` (note memory usage and time)

## Supporting Material/References:

> State all technical information about the stack where the vulnerability was found

- Arch Linux Current
- Node.js 4.8.7

# Wrap up

- I contacted the maintainer to let them know: Y
- I opened an issue in the related repository:  N

I tried to contact the maintainer over email, first time on 2017-03-02, last time on 2018-02-18, but did not receive a reply.

## Impact

Sensitive uninitialized memory exposure
Denail of Service
This issue affects only setups using Node.js 4.x (still supported) or lower.
