Summary:

I would like to report an uninitialized Buffer allocation issue in `put`.
It allows to extract sensitive data from uninitialized memory by passing in non-round numbers, in setups where typed user input can be passed (e.g. from JSON).

# Module

**module name:** `put`
**version:** 0.0.6
**npm page:** `https://www.npmjs.com/package/put`

## Module Description

> Pack multibyte binary values into buffers with specific endiannesses.

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

`put` incorrectly calculates the total length of the allocated Buffer and does not trim it to the total bytes written, see https://github.com/substack/node-put/blob/master/index.js#L51

The problem arises when non-round numbers are passed in to the `pad` function.
The API should not propagate the already-bad Buffer issue further.

On Node.js 6.x and below, this exposes uninitialized memory, which could contain sensitive data.

## Steps To Reproduce:

```js
var Put = require('put');
var buf = Put().pad(0.99).pad(0.99).pad(0.99).pad(0.99).pad(0.99).buffer();
console.log(buf);
```

```js
var Put = require('put');
var buf = Put();
for (var i = 0; i < 10000; i++) buf.pad(0.99);
console.log(buf.buffer().toString('ascii'));
```

Run on Node.js 6.x or below.

## Supporting Material/References:

## Impact

Sensitive uninitialized memory exposure on Node.js 6.x or lower
