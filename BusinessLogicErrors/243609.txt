Summary:

Hello,

## Description:

The username of an account can be set to `..`. This makes it impossible to view the public profile of this account.

## POC:

I have claimed the username `..` on the demo.weblate.org site. It is impossible to view this account's public profile page. 
Here is the public profile page: https://demo.weblate.org/user/../

## Mitigation

I recommend you filtering usernames to prevent them from starting with `.`.

Thanks!
