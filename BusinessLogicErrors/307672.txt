Summary:

# Description

The following snippet in `js/identities.js` allows all hostnames ending in `twitter.com`, `facebook.com`, [etc.](https://github.com/keybase/client/blob/master/browser/js/identities.js#L24-L66) to display the Keybase message window. The issue stems from the fact that you use `\.` instead of `\\.` in your regular expression.

```js
{
    service: "twitter",
    getUsername: function(loc) { return loc.pathname.split('/')[1]; },
    locationMatches: new RegExp('\.twitter\.com/([\\w]+)[/]?$'),
    originAndPathMatches: '\.twitter\.com/[\\w]+[/]?$',
    css: ['body.ProfilePage']
  },
```

# PoC

```
$ cat /etc/hosts
IP_HERE totallynottwitter.com
```

Start up a little server and navigate to IP_HERE/edoverflow. Click on the Keybase extension's icon and the message window will pop up, tying @EdOverflow Twitter's identity to totallynottwitter.com.

# Mitigation

Make sure to use `\\.` in your regular expression.

## Impact

An attacker can create a fake page with any of the white-listed hostnames, and the extension's messaging window will open on the page.
