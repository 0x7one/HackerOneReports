Summary:

Hello KhanAcademy Security Team,

I'm rootbakar, I found an oddity that allows a user to register with Khanacademy using an invalid or fake email.

In this trial I used the email 'rootbakar@rootbakar.rootbakar' and after pressing the **SIGN UP** button it will automatically enter the user dashboard page, not through the account verification process first.

This will enable someone to create multiple accounts at once without verification.
