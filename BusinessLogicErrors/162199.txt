Summary:
When a rider account had an outstanding account balance, improper validation of the payment method ID provided in the request made it possible to use an invalid payment method. As a result, it was possible to provide a non-existent payment type ID such as `xyz` when requesting a ride and get the trip for free. In addition to this, the vulnerability was trivial to reproduce and could have been easily abused. 

Thanks, @appsecure_in!
