Summary:
While going live with additional 2FA options, a security researcher discovered that while we provide a TOTP fallback and Recovery code fallback for users that have enabled U2F, we neglected to do this for TOTP-only users. All users that have enabled TOTP or U2F 2FA should have been able to access the recovery code feature.
