Summary:
@zhurig found a race condition where it was possible to bypass the limit for the number of locations a store can have by submitting multiple requests at once. We have resolved this issue by adding extra transactional locking during store location changes.
User can bypas restriction and create more ctore location, than maximum depends store plan. Intercept request and send it multiple at once. See screensots
