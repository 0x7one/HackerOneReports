Summary:

Sequel to the fix on #243594, this is still possible.

##Reproduction Steps
1. Request password reset
- Load the link in email and set a new password
- Navigate to https://demo.weblate.org/accounts/reset/
- Fill the email and captcha
- You'll be prompted to enter a new password

NOTE: I figured that if action is not performed after a few minutes, then this doesn't work. 

I suggest you make the link expire after use than setting a time frame.

Best!
