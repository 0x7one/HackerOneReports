Hi team.
 
I made 2 accounts and purchased burpsuite pro.
The first account with this email :- ███████
The second account with this email :- ██████

I have opened a support ticket on  Jun 13, 2018 05:26PM and the message is :- 

Hi

Could you please add this account to my existing account


████
███████

to may another account

Email address: ██████████
███

and change the name from

licensed to Sara Badran [single user license]

To

Burp Suite Professional - licensed_to_Emad__Shanab_[single_user_license]

Because i made a purchase from my another account but my old license will expire in 2 month and i need to merge my new account with the old one in one license and please change the license hash because i feel Iam, get hacked

Thanks

The another license is:-

Attachments | Burp_Suite_Professional_-_licensed_to_Emad__Shanab__single_user_license_.txt 

I just need to merge the accounts or change the license name to me with new hash to avoid any one to use it .

Thanks

And the team replied to me with this message:-- 

Hi Emad,

We have transferred the license key on █████ to █████████’s account.

Please let us know if you need any further assistance.


Now the license have transferred to my another account but i still can activate the burp with the old license with licensed to Sara Badran [single user license]

Now i have 2 licenses with one price and 2 different names. 

Please tell me if you need more information.

Thanks.

## Impact

This issue can lead to use 2 license with 2 different names with one price.
