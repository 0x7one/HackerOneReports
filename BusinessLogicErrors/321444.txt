Summary:

## Description
In report https://hackerone.com/reports/307670 the reported identified a flow which abuses parsing differences between Keybase and Hackernews. Also the original reports is resolved there appears to be a bypass having the same impact by abusing upper-case letters.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Browse to: https://news.ycombinator.com/user?iD=rbanffy&id=blaa
2. Click on the Keybase Extension icon.
3. Notice that the pop-up shows the username blaa while thehackernews page shows the username: rbanffy (See attached image).

## Root cause
Keybase only searches for lower-case letters, however thehackernews allows upper-case ones to.

## Impact

Users attempting to send a secure, sensitive message to a Keybase user can be tricked into sending that message to a malicious user instead.
