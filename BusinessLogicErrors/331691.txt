Summary:

###STEPS TO REPRODUCE:

1. I have found a sandboxed team in hackerone,named █████.
2. The manager of that team sends an invitation to: ██████████ ( which email was not exist on hackerone account)
3. Now the invitation link receive was ========> ████
4. I logged in from multiple researcher account and visited the link and accepted the request. 
5. Now the invitation link was still live.

So, a member  can pass this token to other people and they will be added to the team.I used this token multiple times and it's still live.

## Impact

The invitation token can be use in multiple times.
