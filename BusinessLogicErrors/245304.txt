Summary:

Following the fixes: #241608 & #224072. there's still another way round this.

##Reproduction Steps
1. Register 2 accounts (Preferably using Gmail not third party)
- Login both accounts on separate browsers
- In Browser1, navigate to https://demo.weblate.org/accounts/profile/#auth
- Add a new association with the Google third party link using the registered email address in Browser2
- Fill the Password and Add the Association
- Disconnect the email on the account initially
- Email will be changed to the new one added in (4)
- Now, both browsers have the same email address i.e 2 accounts with a single email
- Logging out any of the account and trying to login leads to a server error.
