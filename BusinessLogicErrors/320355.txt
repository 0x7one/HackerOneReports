Summary:
On February 27, 2018, Shopify support received notification that `myshopify.com` was being redirected to a specific Shopify store. We tracked the behaviour down to tests from @0xacb. Unknowingly, he identified a bug in our domain verification and path creations, which allowed for the registration of a Shopify owned domain name despite domain verification failing. We fixed our path registration process immediately and reached out to him to ensure he was compensated for his work.
Hello Shopify Security Team,

I just received your email and I'm sorry for any inconvenience. Yes, it was me.
Basically, I just tried to audit your website using some black box testing. Unfortunately, I didn't read about those guidelines, such as creating a store on https://partners.shopify.com/ and I created a normal trial account.

I'm glad you found a bug as a result of inspecting my activity logs. And you're right, I didn't notice the bug.

I tried many different things, such as:

- I tried to bypass the open redirect filter, without success: https://www.shopify.com/login?redirect=//acme
- I explored the domain DNS check tool to get RCE without success. I tried to use some command injection techniques, but I didn't receive any requests on my server (█████). I tried to use curl and netcat to perform external requests.
- I think I managed to add domains that were not verified by the DNS tool by submitting them using the last endpoint, but those domains remain "Not connected".

I have all my requests on Burp, but I didn't save the session. As far as I can remember, this was what I tested. I would like to know what was the bug. If possible, I would like to test it further.

Thank you,
André
