Summary:

Hi Team,

I have found a logical flaw(NOT DoS) in the website 'https://app.mopub.com/' 


1.Use Burp Suite and capture below request upon navigation to *Code integration*
2.Click on Send button after entering email address in the input field of 'Enter one or more email addresses and we'll send you links to the integration instructions for this ad unit.'
{code}
POST /web-client/api/ad-units/email-instructions HTTP/1.1

Connection: close

{"addresses":["§████@mailinator.com§"],"key":"███"}
{code}
3.Send the captured request to INtruder and repeat the request in loop
4.Observe that email box is flooded with MoPub ad unit integration instructions

Remediation:
Rate limiting should be implemented
