Summary:

**Summary:**

Changing victim's JIRA integration settings through multiple bugs.

**Description:**

Using multiple HackerOne bugs, an attacker can change the victim's JIRA integration settings.

### Bugs:

###1) The Jira integration consent screen lacks information about the Jira project that will be connected to HackerOne

{F181926}
***Malicious or good Jira trying to connect above?***
Impossible to know without clicking on `Link JIRA Instance to program`, this is bad.

###2) JIRA project automatic selection

When a user already have a JIRA connected to his HackerOne program, if an attacker sends 
a malicious link to him (with a malicious JIRA JWT token in it), clicking on `Link JIRA Instance to program` will change the JIRA account connected to the program and worst, it will automatically select the attacker's JIRA project without user interaction. Any new HackerOne report will be cloned to the attacker's JIRA project.

###3) Bypassing HackerOne link protection

[Link protection bypass](https://hackerone.com/users/%2E/saml/sign_in?email=teste@hackerone.com)

###4) HackerOne SAML Open Redirector ( #171398 )

###5) Jira OAuth CSRF

{F181925}

{F181924}

### Conclusion:

An attacker can use all bugs above in many ways to try to link his own JIRA project to the victim's HackerOne program.
