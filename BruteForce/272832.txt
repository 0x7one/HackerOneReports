Summary:

Hi team,

This is my first ever report. So, thank you for your patience!


URL: https://www.boozt.com/login
Browser: Mozilla Firefox 55.0.2 (64-bit) on Ubuntu
Tool: Burp Intruder
Boozt account created for testing purposes only.

I noticed that on your login page, an attacker can Brute force a login because there is no set limit of failed login tries.

Somebody can iterate passwords a vast number of times and brute force to login as other users.

No stop, temporary block is enforced. The victim's account is not alerted if any given number of consecutive failed  authentications is performed.

The error "CSRF token invalid" is displayed (this is another issue - I think you should never display such a message to an attacker). 

But, even with the CSRF token issue, by starting the browser again and submitting the login with the newly found password, the login is successful.

I used Burp Intruder and the total number of consecutive requests were 200. 

Delay between requests: 3 seconds.


Thank you!
Regards,
Chris
