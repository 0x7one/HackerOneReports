Summary:

# Description
The host at ws1.dashlane.com throttles requests based on the IP address of the user after a certain amount of repeated requests.
By adding the `X-Forwarded-For` header, an attacker can bypass the throttling completely, rendering the security measure ineffective against DOS attacks. 

# Proof of concept
1. Send a large amount of requests like the following until a `{"error":{"code":-32600,"message":"Throttled."}}` message is received.
2. Send another request with an added `X-Forwarded-For` header : 
3. The web server will respond with a successful message instead of a throttled response.

I have attached two screenshots demonstrating the proof of concept.

Thank you,
