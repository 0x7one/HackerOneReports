URL: https://apps.nextcloud.com/password/reset/

I have tried to recover the password for some emails:

test@test.com (exists)
teste@teste.com.br (does not exists)

After I clicked the "reset my password"'s button, the website informed that the email did not exist.

## Impact

This is a bad practice, and it is an invitation to brute force emails that possibly exist in the domain @nextcloud.com.

By using a wordlist of common passwords, it is possible to guess a combination of email/password of an administrator account.
