Summary:

Hi security team,
i [reported](https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131562)  some samples triggered crash in eval funtion in perl. 
The bug come because variable `start` and `items` used type `I32` which takes half the range of line_t and folds it into negative numbers, leading to trying to store the lines at negative indexes.
