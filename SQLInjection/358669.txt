Summary:
@saltedfish found that a parameter `order_id` was vulnerable to SQLi.

###POC 
(for everyone to learn from this disclosed report)

- There was an endpoint which had `order_id` as one of the parameters.
- Requesting `'-if(1=2,'0','1')-'`  in `order_id` parameter changed the Response Length and upon further investigation from @saltedfish, he found that the boolean technique could be used to proof data retrieval.

We'd like to thank @saltedfish for helping us in keeping @zomato secure :)

[REQUEST] Also, a small request to everyone reading this report, Burp Suite Free Version offers lot of features to start with and HackerOne has partnered with Burp Suite to offer 3 months free of Burp Suite Pro to Hackers on achieving `500 Reputation Points`. Use that opportunity instead of using Pirated Version.

Cheers.
