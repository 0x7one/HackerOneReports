Summary:
##Issue

The issue was investigated and found to be valid. The fix was to remove the application as it was not needed.

##Reasoning

The reported case was valid and within the scope of the bug bounty program. The issue was fixed and the reporter was awarded with a bounty. The report shows that the whole life cycle of an application must be considered and special care must be taken to ensure that outdated and unnecessary applications are removed in a timely manner.

We have found that the underlying infrastructure and database contained a limited set of non-public customer related information. For this reason, we have decided to award this report with a one time additional bonus awarded in #200214. Fairness and transparency are key in a successful bug bounty program.
