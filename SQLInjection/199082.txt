Summary:
##Issue

The reporter found issues related to previous reports: #167453, #170532, #173563 and #176574. It was found to be possible to circumvent some of the protections that have been put in place earlier on to prevent access to protected resources within the Oracle Webcenter Sites application. The potential attacks include ability to execute arbitrary operations against the database, access to configuration files of the system, access to installation / uninstallation URLs and ability to access sensitive user related information in the solution database.

##Fix

Additional protections were tested and put in place.

##Reasoning

Mitigating issues and protecting off the shelf applications can prove to be a path of trial and error. However, the effort and risk of failing and re-iterating is a lesser evil than doing nothing at all. Reports like this prove that running a bug bounty program is an excellent way of slowly but surely solving issues that otherwise most probably would go undetected and completely under the radar.
