Summary:

Hi there, 
The https://www.dropbox.com// (Double slash) request returns Internal Server Error( 500 Error) and doesn't returns 404 so i believe it may be an injection. 
https://www.dropbox.com//shell.php any text added after the double slash will cause the same thing .
It is a valid bug an should be triggered, please.
You have overlooked that the hacker can make many half connection to the server and cause a connection flood also can make a denial of service attack on your server . Users will be annoyed if the get  accessed to this link by sharing it in any social media and help the hacker to make half connections .
I will be very happy if you provide me with the bounty. 
I will tell you about a new bug  soon,I am working on it.
