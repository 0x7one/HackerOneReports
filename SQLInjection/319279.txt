The hacker selected the **SQL Injection** weakness. This vulnerability type requires contextual information from the hacker. They provided the following answers:

**Please describe the results of your verification attempt.**
After submitting a single quote, I got the 500 error. after few steps, I got rid of the 500 error by forging a valid sql query which is as follows:
https://www.khanacademy.org/translations/videos/en'%20or'1'=='1_youtube_stats.csv 
it returns to me all csv since 1 is equal to one
when changing the boolean condition:
https://www.khanacademy.org/translations/videos/en'%20AND'1'=='0_youtube_stats.csv
(and '1'=='0): only the english csvs are shown.
