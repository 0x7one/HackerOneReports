Summary:
##Issue

The reporter found an SQL injection in one of the applications in viestinta.lahitapiola.fi. 

##Fix

The issue was investigated and found to be valid and critical. 

##Reasoning

The reported case was valid and right on target for the scope of the bug bounty program. SQL injections are always critical as they pose a serious threat to the underlying database and the information therein. Even in the case of the data being public information - as was the case here -  there are still many vectors for seriously misusing this kind of a vulnerability. 

The bounty decision was based on the fact that the reporter found two very similar vulnerabilities (a pattern issue, #181803 and #181826) -  the bounty was bundled and then split amongst both reports.
