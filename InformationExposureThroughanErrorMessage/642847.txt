Summary:
The current system only works for India so ISD Code of India i.e +91 is mandatory for Registration. During the Registration system was accepting any country ISD code due to Request was not validated by the system instead whatever sent through client-side modification is accepted. So the Strict Validation has been put to avoid any client-side modified request to accept any ISD code.
