Summary:
An XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability was discovered in the `x.js` endpoint on https://duckduckgo.com via `u` parameter. This was due to improper sanitation of external XML entities. The results was a leak of certain world readable files on the system.

This issue was patched. Additionally, we intend to retire the endpoint in the very near future.

Big thanks to @mik317 for reporting this issue!
