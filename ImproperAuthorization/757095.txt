Summary:
The Razer Pay MY backend API had an access control vulnerability which would allow a client to delete the account of other users by varying the ID.  Although an adversary could not target a specific individual by name, they could affect the integrity of the Razer Pay system.

This was fixed in production on 12/19.  We thank the tester for his report.
