Summary:

**Summary:**
You wrote that some programs are behind, but you are trying to get them back (sorry maybe bad translation)

**Description:**
Apparently because of a system error, I have access to change information in the public program.
This option is given only for external programs.But here is a public program, so I create a report

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Go to @uzbey -- https://hackerone.com/uzbey
2. I can see button `edit`
F348953
3. Try to change `about`
4. I write -- `test @jobert`
F348952

Check about page
`The goal of Uzbey is to create the worlds largest selfie to be launched into space. test @jobert`
Hi @jobert :)


PS I understand that this is an old program, but it has the ability to return. Perhaps there are still such programs.I'm still searching. If I understood something wrong, then close the report as information, thank you!

fix: to change the program state

Sorry i bad speak english
