Summary:
Send repeated reminders to user involved in specific program - found and fixed internally.
Hi,

Attacker could setup the reminder for bulk  no of amount of accounts using there phone no's. He could setup infinite no of reminders. Tried brute force for 100 times worked perfectly
here is the link : https://widgets.uber.com/american-airlines-reminders/
Here any phone-no is accepted. Actually logged in user phone-no should be cross checked.

TCP DUMP while setting up reminder:

```

{"event":{"time":1470940200},"phone_number":"+919949111969","reminder_time":1470937500}
```

Send that request to intruder in burp and try to brute force. Setting up reminder is always shown with response code 200 .
my reminder was setup on Thu, 11 Aug 2016 17:45:00 GMT multiple times. Attacker could perform this on multiple phone-no.
This could issue for user's because their phone gets constantly notifications.
