Summary:

Hello,

Make email primary doesn't have a csrf protection.

Proof Of Concept :
===============
I copied this form from site.

<form action="/settings/email" method="post" class="ng-pristine ng-valid">
<input type="hidden" name="id" value="236106">	
<input type="hidden" name="form" value="primary">									<span class="link make-primary" ng-click="Settings.Email.make_primary(236106)">Make primary</span>
</form>

You can clearly see there is no csrf protection.
Hacking a secondary email of user and then doing this csrf attack against the user will result in compromising of user's account.

I hope you resolve this. :)

Regards,
Pranav
