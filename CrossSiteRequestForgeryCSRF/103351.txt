Summary:

Hi , I have found a CSRF issue in themes.shopify.com when installing premium themes.
#Details:
When going to a premium theme page for example: https://themes.shopify.com/themes/editions/styles/light/ there is a button saying `Preview in your store` , clicking that button sends a **POST** request to `https://themes.shopify.com/themes/editions/styles/light/demo` with an **authenticity token** to prevent CSRF , but going to the url `https://themes.shopify.com/themes/editions/styles/light/demo ` directly will get the theme installed without any validation for the authenticity token.
#Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to themes.myshopify.com then login with your store
2. Go to https://themes.shopify.com/themes/editions/styles/light/demo and the theme `editions` will be installed in your shop
3. To confirm go to `https://<your_store>.myshopify.com/admin/themes` and you'll see the theme installed there.

Thanks
