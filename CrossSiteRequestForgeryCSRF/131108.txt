Summary
-----------

Akismet is vulnerable to CSRF allowing an attacker to cancel accounts of victims, add sites, remove subscriptions, etc.


Steps to reproduce *Account cancelation*
-----------

1. Login to your Akismet account, which has a subscription activated.
2. The following POST request will cancel the subscription and the account:

    `https://akismet.com/api/account/1/cancel`

The `1` can be replaced with any number. The userid was originally there, but I noticed that it actually just gets ignored.


Steps to reproduce other CSRF
--------------------
Basically all actions on Akismet are vulnerable to CSRF. Here are some further examples (`1` can be replaced with 2, 3, etc):

### Adding a site to a subscription:

```
POST /api/activation/create

subscriptionId=1&site_url=foo.bar
```
*foo.bar* is now added to subscription *1*

### Cancel specific subscription:

```POST /api/subscription/1/cancel```
   
Subscription *1* is now canceled.
