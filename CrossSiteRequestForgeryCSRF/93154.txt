Summary:

Hey team i would like to report a real csrf threat which allows attacker to make report abuse to any meme on behalf of the users 

how i found this bug :-

lets visit to any meme example :-

1> http://imgur.com/t/memes/ieTEJEd 
2> i clicked on post options 
3> i got an option called report i clicked on it
4> i selected a option of abusive/offensive 
5>started my intercept and click on report 
6> after intercepting i saw the post request having a unique token like ''Sid'' which maybe for form validations
7>i managed to delete the value of sid and still get a 200 ok status code and it was report abused 

below i will attach the snapshot of the original request edited and response :)

i ve attached images of original request and i have stripped off the formvalidation tokens and session values and passed the request i could still get a 200 ok status which means the vaidations are not properly checked server side
