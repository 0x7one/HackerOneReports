Summary:

Hi Team,

This is a low risk but want you to know that logout on this domain `demo.weblate.org` did not protect the logout form with csrf token, therefor i can logout any user by sending this url `https://demo.webplate.org/accounts/logout/`.

Logout should have post method with a valid csrf token.

Let me know if you need more info.

Regards
Japz
