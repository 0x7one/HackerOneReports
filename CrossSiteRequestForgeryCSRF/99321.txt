Summary:

Hi , i have found a CSRF issue when activating PayPal Express checkout.
#Steps to reproduce: 
1. Create a new store then login with the admin account.
2. Go to `https://<your_store>.myshopify.com/admin/settings/payments` and you'll see that PayPal Express checkout is already active , so click the edit button and deactivate it.
3. Go to the following link: `https://<your_store>.myshopify.com/admin/payments/complete_paypal_oauth/41` and you'll see that PayPal Express checkout was activated and you'll get a message saying: *Successfully activated your account*.

I have been trying to link a malicious paypal email through this CSRF by using the following link: 
`https://<your_store>.myshopify.com/admin/payments/complete_paypal_oauth/41?verification_token=<PAYPAL_TOKEN>` but it doesn't work.

This issue is a little bit confusing when being reproduced since it will only work on a store in which the admin never tried to activate PayPal before because if he did so , a `request token` will be generated and will be validated for whenever the link is visited.

Please tell me if you are having an issue reproducing it and I will send you a PoC video. 

Thanks.
