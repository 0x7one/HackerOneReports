Summary:

The user gets an e-mail with password recovery link, which includes reset password token. The user clicks this link and is expected to enter a new password twice. Before entering the password the user clicks a link to a picture (https://xkcd.com/936/). When this happens, cross-domain referer leakage takes place.

It allows the person who has control of xkcd.com to change the user's password (CSRF attack), because this person knows reset password token of the user, uses a new user's password of his choice and authenticity_token is not needed to make it happen.
