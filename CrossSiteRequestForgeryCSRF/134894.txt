Summary:

The Anti-CSRF Library provides the ability to restrict token to a particular IP address using the variable "$hmac_ip". 

When "$hmac_ip" is set to "true", the token is generated using the predefined variable "$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']" which gives the IP address of the client. However, when the web server is behind a reverse-proxy/WAF/Load-balancer/whatever, which is nowadays often the case, this variable will always return the IP address of the reverse-proxy/WAF/Load-balancer/whatever, failing to restrict the token to the client real IP address.

In order to restrict the token to the user real IP address, the Anti-CSRF Library should also check for the X-Forwared-For HTTP header. However, be advised this header can easily be spoofed. To my knowledge, one cannot ensure a client real IP address.

Both version 1.0.0 and 2.0.0 are affected.
