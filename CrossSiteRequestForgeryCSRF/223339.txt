Summary:

Hi Team,

Domain: `demo.weblate.org`

In this bug, maybe it is low risk but i have found a way to login any person to the attackers account, therefor when any user login to attackers account, the attacker can see the users activity on attackers account. The issue relies on the password reset.

### Stes to reproduce:

  1. Create fake account and generate reset password link.
  2. Go to email, get the reset password link and send it to victim
  3. When victim click the link, victim automatically login to attackers account.

Please note that when the victim clicks the reset password link, victim will redirect to the page that ask to insert password, but even if the victim did not inout password, and click the profile name at the upper right of the reset password page. The victim will redirect to attackers profile account, meaning upon clicking the reset password link, victim already logged in to attackers account.

### Mitigation:

Do not automatically login the user after clicking the reset password link.

Let me know if you need more information.

Regards
