Summary:

Uploading SVG that include

```
 <image xlink:href="http://example.com/?evil=var" />
```

will cause the server side parser to try to fetch external resources.

I've tested in two ways. Creating an svg with an external loaded public google image that was rendered perfectly. 

Also tested a private server with nc and created an svg that uses xlink for private url. I uploaded the svg and nc output was this.
