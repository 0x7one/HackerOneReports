Summary:
There was a lack of CSRF protections on `eats.uber.com` which allowed an attacker to add a credit card to another account. Shortly after reporting, @vijay_kumar1110 noticed other endpoints on the same domain which also lacked CSRF protections and added them to his report. Following further investigation, we found that there was a complete lack of any CSRF protections on `eats.uber.com`, allowing an attacker to make requests on behalf of another user arbitrarily. At the time of reporting, this was thought to be a one-time issue but ended up being something that existed across the rest of the service which increased the severity of this issue.

Thanks, @vijay_kumar1110!
