Summary:

Concrete5 implements a Synchronizer Token Pattern in order to provide anti-CSRF capabilities, which is done within the Concrete\Core\Validation\CSRF\Token class. However, the application fails to properly use this feature in every block or dashboard page which makes a system state change, such as settings modification. As a result, the application is vulnerable to some Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
