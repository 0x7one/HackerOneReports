Summary:

The request to create an account wallet doesn't validate if the request is originating from the user itself with the help of an anti-CSRF token. 

Step 1: Craft an HTML page with request to create a wallet in your accounts page. 
https://www.coinbase.com/accounts > New Account > Wallet

Step 2: Open the HTML page in a tab of the browser where a user is already logged in to coinbase. It can be observed that a wallet is created.

PS: In some browsers this may not work. It should be noted that it is not because the application doesn't have a proper CSRF mitigation mechanism, rather the parameter utf8 is improperly rendered.
