Summary:

Hi,

The CSRF token is not getting expired for a user.This can led to username change and many other account change information as well.

To reproduce the issue:

1) Login into your Slack.com account 
2) Go to this URl https://sehacure.slack.com/account/settings
3) Inspect element  Copy your anti CSRF token i.e. crumb.
4) Now logout from your account.
5) Login again and visit the same page again i.e. https://sehacure.slack.com/account/settings
6) Inspect element and change the value of crumb to token you copied.
7) Change your username now it will be changed.


CSRF tokens should expire as soon as the user logs out and we have to assign a new one when a user signs in :-)

Best regards,
Anand
