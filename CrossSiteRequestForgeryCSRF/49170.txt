Summary:

Hello,
I found a  info disclosure vulnerability. We can enumerate emails via user_id parameter from Manage users.

And I found that :

>ID 1 is webmaster@seatme.com
ID 514755 is troy@yelp.com
ID 514775 is mr.trizaeron@gmail.com
ID 514764 is exists@exists.com

I attached photos from burp repeater to be more explicit.

We can easily bruteforce user_id parameter with ids to harvest user's emails.


Regards,
  Florin
