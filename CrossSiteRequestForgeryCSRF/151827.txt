Summary:

The application is vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery
====================

Description
---------------------
The option in the application to save weekly contribution for a project is vulnerable to Cross Site Request forgery. 
**Note:** I am unable to perform the action itself normally. But it is obvious that the application uses no protection against CSRF and the token named **csrf_token** is being passed in the cookie instead of a post parameter or HTTP header. 

Detailed Steps:
---------------------
**Step 1:** Open a project and modify the weekly contribution for the same. 
{F105367}
**Step 2:** Send the request to save the modified value.
{F105368}
**Step 3:** It can be observed that no kind of CSRF protection is employed and the request can be recreated in the following URL format. If anyone clicks on the link in a browser where they are already logged in to gratipay, the amount will be automatically updated.
