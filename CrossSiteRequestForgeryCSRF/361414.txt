Summary:

Web Application is generating  CSRF_token values inside cookies
which is not a best practice for web applications the revelation of cookies can reveal CSRF Tokens as well.
Authenticity tokens should be kept separate from cookies and should be isolated to change operations in the account only.

## Impact

The CSRF token Which is inside cookie can be manipulated with proxies. So CSRF tokens can be manipulated.

 The server application is not verifying the existence and correctness of CSRF token before processing the request.
Actually, It should be verified on the server application and If the token is missing or incorrect, the request should be rejected.
This can probe to serious issues if exploited.
