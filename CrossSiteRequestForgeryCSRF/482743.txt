Summary:
In this report, the researcher was able to discover a method to expose and exfiltrate Oauth tokens. This was done by injecting an `<img>` tag containing a payload pointing to the attacker's own domain into replies of Support Community forum threads. Once this was done, users operating under a particular set of conditions who opened the attacker's reply would have their Oauth token extracted by the attacker. This issue has been resolved with the researcher's help.
