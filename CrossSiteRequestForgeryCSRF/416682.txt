Summary:

Hi

I noticed Changing video thumbnail option have the workflow with GET request and there is lack of csrf token on changing video thumbnail option,so if attacker somehow able to obtain the thumbnail_id of victim's video then it can help attacker to inducing victim to change video thumbnail.

Vulnerable Request:

GET /photo_videos/video/thumbnail/video_id/?thumb=thumbnail_id HTTP/1.1
Host: chaturbate.com

Steps to reproduce:

setup:-
Video A :- an  uploaded video on victim's account.
video_id :- id of video A from victim's account
thumbnail_id :- id of any thumbnail from video A.

1. Configure the upper setup along with this url https://chaturbate.com/photo_videos/video/thumbnail/video_id/?thumb=thumbnail_id
2. Feed the configured url to victim(as setup in step 1)
3. Wait 5-9 minutes.
4. Open your bio tab.
5. Check, the video thumbnail will successfully get changed.

With Best Regards

## Impact
