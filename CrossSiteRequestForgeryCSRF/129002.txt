Summary:
##Issue

The reporter found an issue when the user creates a "Vakuutustodistus". The last page of the functionality shows a button "Lataa vakuutustodistus omalle koneellesi tulostusta varten." and contains a hidden form input-field "encodedPdfContent". By changing the "encodedPdfContent"-content, a custom PDF-file could be sent to the server and the custom file would then then be opened on the PdfServlet-page and shown back to the user. This was critical as also a CSRF-request was possible on the vulnerable functionality.
##Fix
The issue was investigated and found to be valid. The fix included mitigating the flaw and adding some protective logic to the functionality.

##Reasoning

The reported case was valid and within the scope of the bug bounty program. The issue was fixed and the reporter was awarded with a bounty.
