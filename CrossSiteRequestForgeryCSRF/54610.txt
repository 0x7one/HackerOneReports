Summary:

It is possible for a user to logout other member of same team even if they had selected *Keep me signed in* option.

**Steps to Verify:**
1. Login to your team i.e [https://yourteamname.slack.com](https://yourteamname.slack.com).
2. On new tab on the same browser request a url which would be like [https://yourteamname.slack.reset/youareloggedout](https://yourteamname.slack.reset/youareloggedout)
3. You will be automatically logged out of your account even if you have selected **Keep me signed in** option.

Attacker can embed the invalid password reset link in a image tag in a website of his/her control and when users visists the page they will be logged out.

`<html>
<head>
	<title>I Logged You Out</title>
</head>
<body>
<img src='https://yourteamname.slack.com/reset/youareloggedout'>
</body>
</html>`

You should not logout a user when an invalid password reset link is accessed rather than you should redirect a user to homepage whenever a password reset link is accessed when user is allready logged in.
