Summary:
##Issue

The reporter found a flaw where it was possible to brute force unsubscribe on one of the apps on viestinta.lahitapiola.fi.

##Fix

The issue was investigated and found to be valid.  The application was fixed.

##Reasoning

Brute force unsubscription does not put any customer data at risk, but poses a real risk for business functions relying on contacting and meeting customers. In real life, unsubscribing does not directly affect participation in events, but makes estimating participation difficult.
