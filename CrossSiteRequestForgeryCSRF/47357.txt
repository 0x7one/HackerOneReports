Problem is that this request works with 
 X-CSRFToken: LI6qbdczbgPPQ7fxXR3duFENgY1qr3wB
this token i got from another account
the real token was 
AlEqSERKOXKjZfSdw2WtPY4l7n5b68BM

This issue make possible to attacker bypass CSRF using his own valid token (for example thru xss). Best practice is:
- token from different user do not work on other session
- and much better if token change on each request
