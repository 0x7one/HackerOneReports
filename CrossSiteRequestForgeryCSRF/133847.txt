Summary:
# Report

Because the ProBlogs plugin did not validate the anti-csrf token on a POST request. A victim who is logged in could be fooled into clicking a malicious form (styled to look like a link, image, etc) which would create a page in their C5 website.

Because the ProBlogs plugin does not validate the parent cID asserting it is the actual Blog, the attacker could potentially place the page anywhere on the C5 site map tree.

Because C5 discloses the CCM_CID in a set of <script></script> tags on every page, an attacker could also derive which parentID they would like to target. This would allow the attacker to either place the page in a non-obvious spot or place the page in a high traffic area depending on the attacker's use case.

The blogBody form value would include a javascript payload which could potentially harvest data, install malware, or inject another payload for further exploitation of the C5 site or surrounding infrastructure.

A CORS based attack is also a possibility here though it is much more unlikely given the current state of modern browsers.


# Resolution
Change report for v2.6.8 of ProBlog:

* tools file addBlog now sanitizes postID
* tools file addBlog now utilizes core CSRF\Token
* tools file addBlog view now generates CSRF\Token
* Tools file addBlog now validates the parentID is an existing section in addition to the existing permissions check that was there.
