Summary:

This bug is related to bug report [https://hackerone.com/reports/774] as this bug also allows a user to be logged in as the attacker. 

An attacker could exploit this bug as follows:

Attacker initiates Google OAuth process with thisdata
Attacker allows access to thisdata app
Attacker records and drops redirection to thisdata (in order not to consume token)
Attacker directs victim to /oauth/redirect?state={attacker's state}&code={attacker's code}
Victim is now logged in as attacker

state parameter is solution for this but in this case state parameter is not getting validated on server side.
