Summary:

Hello,

When you visit any projects from `https://hosted.weblate.org/` , there is a button provided on top-right called `Watch` / `Unwatch` for each projects. when you click on that button, a POST request is sent which contains csrf token.  But this request also works without that token.

Just hit the urls in your browser and you will be able to `Watch` or `Unwatch` the projects

`https://hosted.weblate.org/accounts/watch/androbd/`
https://hosted.weblate.org/accounts/unwatch/androbd/
