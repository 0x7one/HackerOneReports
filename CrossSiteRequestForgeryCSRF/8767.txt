Summary:

I noticed that the login page at `/login` does not prevent CSRF logins. I recommend taking a look at [the risks of not protecting login against CSRF](http://andrisatteka.blogspot.nl/2014/01/the-threat-of-login-csrf.html) and possibly protect the form against attacks like this with a token (just like in the rest of the application).
