## Summary:
A heap buffer overflow can occur at line 1114 in file `lib/tftp.c` due to the fact of `state->blksize` containing the default size instead of containing the one specified in the `--tftp-blksize` parameter.

This bug could lead to a **crash** or maybe to **RCE** in the case the attacker also had a memory leak.


### Vulnerable line:
```
state->rbytes = (int)recvfrom(state->sockfd,
                                (void *)state->rpacket.data,
                                state->blksize + 4,
                                0,
                                (struct sockaddr *)&fromaddr,
                                &fromlen);
```


## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Download the server script
  1. Run it and bind to an address: `$ python evil-server.py IP PORT`
  1. Connect to that server with curl: `$ curl --tftp-blksize N tftp://IP:PORT`
Where **N** should be a number lower than 293.

## Impact

* An attacker would also need a memory leak in order to gain full RCE.
* The victim should explicitly set the `--blksize` argument to a value inferior to 293.

Thus, the impact is not very high but it's still quite dangerous to not release a patch.
