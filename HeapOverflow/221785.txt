WeaknessName:Heap Overflow

Summary:
An overflow can occur in MDC2_Update() either if called directly or through the EVP_DigestUpdate() function using MDC2. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption.

The amount of data needed is comparable to SIZE_MAX which is impractical on most platforms.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2i
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1u

This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 11th August 2016 by Shi Lei (Gear Team, Qihoo 360 Inc.). The fix was developed by Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL development team.
