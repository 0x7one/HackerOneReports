Summary:

Hello,

By default the Nexus Repository Manager has two login users one is admin and the other is anonymous.

The default password for the user "admin" is admin123
The default password for the user "anonymous" is anonymous

On your Nexus Repository Manager the password for the user admin has been changed but the user anonymous was left with the same default password.

For security reasons, please disable the user anonymous or change its password as soon as possible.

Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Go to https://repo.tomtom.com/
  2. Click on the "Sign In" button at the top right of the page
  3. Enter anonymous in the user field 
  4. Enter anonymous in the password field
  5. Click on the "Sign In" button

Proof of concept: 
Kindly check the attached video for proof of concept.

## Impact

Access to the repositories and the ability to change the details (email) for the user anonymous.
