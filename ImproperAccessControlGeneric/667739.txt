Summary:
@brdoors3 found a design issue in MFA implementation: previously created sessions aren't invalidated after MFA activation.
No users affected.

Thanks, @brdoors3!
Hi team,

I found one issue related to your 2FA system on https://account.grammarly.com/security

POC

1 access the same account on https://account.grammarly.com in two devices
2 on device 'A' go to https://account.grammarly.com/security > complete all steps to activate the 2FA system

Now the 2FA is activated for this account

3 back to device 'B' reload the page

The session still active

## Impact

In this scenario when 2FA is activated the other sessions of the account are not invalidated.

2FA is required to login. I believe the expected and recommended behavior here is to terminate the other sessions> request a new login> request the 2FA code> so then give the account access again
