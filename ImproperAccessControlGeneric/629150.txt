Summary:
@modam3r5 discovered an issue where an attacker could disable the Timeline section associated with a discount code by referencing a non-existent product variant in a comment, which resulted a exception being raised. The page for a discount would still render, except for the Timeline. The issue was fixed by rendering the Timeline properly regardless of the contents of user comments.

Unfortunately this report wasn't eligible for a bounty because it was not one of our eligible vulnerability types. While we occasionally make exceptions for high-impact issues that fall outside our bounty table, the impact in this case is not sufficient to justify an exception.
Hi,

I found this cool behavior by mistake when I was testing for some `GraphQL`, any user have ability to comment in `discounts code ` at discounts section can turn off comments to the other staff members include the admin/manager of the store.
this happens because when the `GraphQL` used to create a comment that contains a **Reference page** TAG and this TAG for an another store `Reference page` this will make the request return with an internal error that will affect the conversion on the **discounts code** that will lead to disabled it to everyone on the store include the manager/staff of the store.

#PoC
1. create two staffs `[admin1] - [admin2]` in store.
2. from **admin1** create a discount code and add a comment on it.
3. from **admin2** go to the discount code that had been created, turn-on the `Burpsuite` and add a comment.
4. catch the `GraphQL` request and add this in value of parameter ==message== `[#V12221027811351| ]` and send the request.
5. the response will return with an error like this

```json
{"errors":
[
{"message":"Internal error. Looks like something went wrong on our end.\nRequest ID: d8358e69-631c-45a7-929b-630b9abf8b5c (include this in support requests)."}
]
}
```
now if you refresh the page or going direct to **discount code** link will return with an error like this picture below
{F516543}

and the only way to browser the **discount code** that you had added a comment on it is from `/admin/discounts/` and then click on the **discount code** and it will open without include/show the comment section in the footer of discount code page.

```

change the only value of parameter `resourceId` with ID of your **discount code ** that you created in the store.

this video explain the behavior in case i missed something in the **PoC** steps

## Impact

this can let any other stuff disabled the comment section on any discount code if he/she has the permission to reach it.
