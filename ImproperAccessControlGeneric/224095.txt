Summary:

**Description:**

The email API `https://yoursite/index.php/login?user=admin` to reset password is unlimited and can be used as a email bomb

vuln address:`https://yoursite/index.php/lostpassword/email`

**Reproduce steps:(use demo.owncloud.org as example)**

1.`https://demo.owncloud.org/index.php/login` has a default user `admin`

2.then I try to visit `https://demo.owncloud.org/index.php/login`,then I try to login it using `username:admin || password:xxxxx`(password can be any wrong passwords)

3.Then owncloud will prompt you to reset password,if you click it,admin's email box will receive an email.
