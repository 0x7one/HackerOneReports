## Summary:

An attacker is able to login to any email account (that doesn't belong to him) through using the OAuth functionality (https://staging.genasystech.co.uk/d2c-api/v1/account/login/provider)

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Register an account with an email and verify it using the one time code that is asked upon registration, I registered ██████
  2. Go to https://staging.genasystech.co.uk/d2c/, as this will log you out if you're logged in
  3. Open Burp Suite and go to the log in page, make sure you have intercept requests 'on'
  4. Choose 'Sign-in using Google'
  5. Click 'Forward' on all requests until you can select a Gmail account. Then select one belonging to a different email (I chose ████████)
  6. Keep forwarding the request until you see the request like below:

```

```

7. Edit the request by changing the "email" value to your account from step 1 (In my case ███████) and "emailVerified" is true
8. The application will give you a JWT Authz token bound to ██████ instead of █████████
