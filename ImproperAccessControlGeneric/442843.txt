# Root cause
When a user was part of a program and they'd automatically be subscribed to incoming reports OR they'd manually subscribe, their `User` object was added to the `subscribers` relationship on a `Report` model. When they'd leave the program / be removed, this relationship wouldn't be deleted. This meant that every time we'd use the `<report instance>.subscribers` relationship, it may have included users who no longer had access to the `<report instance>`. This is what happened with the Notifications that were created when a report was transferred to another program.

This **only** affected notifications that were sent when a report was transferred to another program.

The changes that this would happen were rather slim. However, due to the [SAML JIT incident](/reports/438306), multiple people were added as subscribers to reports of other programs. We didn't clean those up, as this wasn't part of the `TeamMember::Destroy` interactor logic. When one of the affected customers of the SAML JIT incident moved one of their reports, all of the report subscribers received a notification, which included employees of other programs.
Hi Hackerone team,

I am still able to access other program details etc. when i'm authenticated to HackerOne through SAML .
I'm not sure if it's the same bug i reported earlier or there is some weak authorization check in place. PFA for more info i can access related to ██████████ etc. See the date it's 16th November .

Quick Note:
Last time when i reported the issue the H1 team decided not to reward it. https://hackerone.com/reports/438306
However this time it's happening again. I can stop reaching out to H1 if they don't reward the ethical researchers who are willing to help their platform more secure.

Please consider this as a  valid finding and reward it this time .

## Impact

This could be a serious issue for HackerOne since the program owners will loose trust in the service and might stop using this platform .
