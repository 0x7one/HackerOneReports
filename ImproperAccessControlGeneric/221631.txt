Summary:

The subdomain ux.shopify.com points to domains.tumblr.com, but this subdomain is not used by anyone on Tumblr. Any user can register his blog for this subdomain.
```
ux.shopify.com.	3600	IN	CNAME	domains.tumblr.com.
```

As an PoC, I registered a blog for this subdomain. It is available only with the password **c7gBX6gELPFLhYOeYxQD**.

http://ux.shopify.com/

You need to remove the DNS entry ux.shopify.com. Or I can release this subdomain so that you can register it.
