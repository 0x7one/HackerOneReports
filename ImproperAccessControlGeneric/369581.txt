Summary:

Hi security team,

**Summary:** It is possible to upload files to the server using the PUT method

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. I used the following request:

```
PUT /emitrani.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: ratelimited.me
Content-Length: 10
Connection: close

emitrani POC
```
Now a file exists at https://ratelimited.me/emitrani.txt
with contents of the put request.

## Impact

Anyone can upload files to the server.
