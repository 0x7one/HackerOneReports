Summary:
User uploaded text files can be linked from external websites and end up appearing in search engine result pages if you perform a search such as: `site:*.irccloud-cdn.com ext:txt`

It's not possible to completely prevent such listings on all search engines, but some search crawlers support the `X-Robots-Tag` header which can be used to indicate indexing is disallowed.

This header was added as a result of this report.
