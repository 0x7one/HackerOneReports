Summary:

##Description
Hello. I discovered Reflected XSS on the stage-go.wepay.com.

##Browsers & OS tested
The XSS checked in the latest IE 11 and Edge on Windows 7. 
Not checked on Windows 10.

#POC (IE 11 or Edge)
```
http://test.xpoc.pro/xss2.php?host=stage-go.wepay.com&payload='"s\src=data:,alert%28document.domain%29></script><script/x='
```
{F259515}

##Root cause
The server do not properly neutralize user input. It thinks that incoming path is urlencoded, and reflects it on the page, but IE/Edge does not urlencode paths, if it passed through Location header.
And since there was multiple payload reflections on the page, i bypassed built-in XSS filter with specific payload.

##Suggested fix
Additionally sanitize reflected user input.

## Impact

The XSS works in the latest versions of IE/Edge, however it is not working in Chrome/FF.
Otherwise, it has same impact as usual reflected XSS - it can steal sensitive info, deface the site, conduct cookie bomb attacks, bypass CORS/csrf protection, etc.
