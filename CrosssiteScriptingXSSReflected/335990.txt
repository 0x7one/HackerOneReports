Summary:
#Issue
The reporter found several flash-files with reflected XXS in the WP installation.

##Fix

The issue was resolved during normal patching of Wordpress.

##Reasoning

Based on the report, the issue was found to be valid. Working single click open redirects which are easily usable in phishing attacks are always an issue for us. For future readers of this report - rewards for issues that are fixed by normal patching may vary, this also applies to reports based purely on CVE-database information.
## Basic report information
**Summary:** 
The lahitapiolarahoitus.fi contains an SWF-file which is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting attacks via crafted URL.

**Description:** 
The file `https://www.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi/wp-includes/js/mediaelement/mediaelement-flash-audio-ogg.swf` contains a XSS-vulnerability which allows malicious actor to create URLs which contain javascript. When the victim (anonymous or authenticated) opens this URL, the javascript is executed on the victim's session.

**Impact:**
The vulnerability allows an attacker to use every functionality on lahitapiolarahoitus.fi that the victim is able to use. In case of an admin-victim, the attacker can use this to gain RCE on the server by uploading a malicious shell-plugin. The vulnerability can also be used to redirect the victim to a malicious third-party domain and also to serve spoofed content on the lahitapiolarahoitus.fi-domain. If the myynti.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi uses domain-wide cookies, this vulnerability can possibly be used to read/write these cookies. 

## Browsers / Apps Verified In:

  * Latest Firefox
  * Latest Internet Explorer
  * Latest Edge

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Go to URL https://www.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi/wp-includes/js/mediaelement/mediaelement-flash-audio-ogg.swf?uid="]}))}catch(e){}alert(document.cookie)//
  2. Notice, that the user's cookies are shown.

## Mitigation

As the vulnerable files are removed in the latest Wordpress version, simply update your own version to the latest one. If the previous is not possible, just remove the swf-files as those are fairly rarely neede.
