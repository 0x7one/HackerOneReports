WeaknessName:Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected
Reporter:https://hackerone.com/gromoza

Summary:
@gromoza reported a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability that affected some Shopify storefronts. The vulnerability resulted from improper handling of the `q` parameter, which was not properly escaped when placed into the [`collection` object](https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid/objects/collection) in Liquid. As a result, stores that included `collection.title` in an HTML attribute would be vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting. A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the storefront could be used by unauthenticated users to attack the admin area of a store, given that the storefront is hosted on the same origin as the admin area of a store.
