Summary:
The base parameter of `/oidauth/prompt` on multiple uberinternal.com subdomains was not sanitized before being reflected into the page body, making it vulnerable to reflected XSS. Additionally, these pages were affected by a clickjacking vulnerability that made exploitation easier, since a click was required to trigger the XSS.
