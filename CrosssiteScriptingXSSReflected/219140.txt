Summary:
##Issue

The reporter found issues related to previous reports, namely #170532 (aka. the gift that keeps on giving). This time the page ```pagename=TAArchiveWrapper``` and the ```localisation``` -parameter was vulnerable to XSS.

##Fix

Additional protections were tested and put in place.

##Reasoning

Mitigating issues and protecting off the shelf applications can prove to be a path of trial and error. Some applications, especially COTS, can be so complicated that there will be a continuous flow of small surprises. Reports like this prove that running a bug bounty program is an excellent way of slowly but surely solving issues that otherwise most probably would go undetected and completely under the radar.
