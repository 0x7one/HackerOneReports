Summary:
Ren√© Kroka found a Reflected XSS vulnerability that could be chained to a Stored XSS attack in the Invision Community forums software used by PUBG.

By crafting a malicious URL the attacker is able to trigger Javascript to execute on their own page; known as Reflected XSS. The attacker then creates a new forum post, or modifies their forum profile. When a link is pasted into a forum post, or profile, the Invision software tries to embed the content into an iFrame to provide an enhanced user experience. An attacker can use a proxy to intercept the iframe as it loads, redirect it to their malicious URL, and trick the forums software into storing their XSS payload and displaying it to other users.

Invision Community fixed this issue in release 4.4.9.1 (https://invisioncommunity.com/release-notes/4491-r91/).
PUBG has upgraded to the latest version which resolved the issue for our installation.
