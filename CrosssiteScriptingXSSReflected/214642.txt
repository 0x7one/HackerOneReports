WeaknessName:Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected
Reporter:https://hackerone.com/twicedi
ReportedTo:Mail.ru(mailru)
BountyAmount:
Severity:
State:Closed
DateOfDisclosure:10.05.2017 14:56:05

Summary:

##Domain, site, application##

The "frag.mail.ru" is affected by a reflected XSS vulnerability on the "/user/register/" handler.


##Testing environment##

The exploitation of the issue has been tested on the latest version (at the time of writing) of Firefox: 52.0.1 (both 32 and 64 bit) on Sierra and Windows 7 OS.

##Steps to reproduce##

To exploit the issue the victim has to visit the following URL: https://frag.mail.ru/user/register/!%22--!%3E%3CImage%0CSrcset%3DK%0COnerror%3Dconfirm%601%60%0C

##Actual results##

Since the input is reflected inside the response and no output encoding is done the payload injected is executed inside the context of the webpage.

##Expected results and recommendations##

To protect the application against cross-site scripting attacks, assume that all input is malicious. Constrain and validate all input. Encode all output that could, potentially, include HTML characters.

##PoC, exploit code, screenshots, video, references, additional resources##

By visiting the following URL: https://frag.mail.ru/user/register/!%22--!%3E%3CImage%0CSrcset%3DK%0COnerror%3Dconfirm%601%60%0C on Firefox, the JavaScript code injected inside the payload is correclty executed, as showed in the following snippet of response and as it is possible to see in the screenshot attached.
