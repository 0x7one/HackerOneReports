WeaknessName:Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected
Reporter:https://hackerone.com/seifelsallamy

Severity:medium

Summary:
A lack of proper input validation made it possible for an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code on `partners.uber.com`. This reflected XSS would execute after making a POST request with an XSS payload in the path of the request. As a result, the server would directly insert the payload into the response, allowing the XSS to trigger on the page.
