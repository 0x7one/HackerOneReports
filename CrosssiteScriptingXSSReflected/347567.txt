Summary:

It seems that people have exploited this vulnerability before on this website, however, it remains unpatched, so here I am reporting the vulnerability.

A XSS vulnerability exists when a restaurant or dish is created with a malicious name. The title of the dish or restaurant is not properly filtered by the web application. Any code in the dish or restaurant name is executed on the client.
