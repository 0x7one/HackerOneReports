WeaknessName:Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected

Summary:

An unauthenticated, reflected cross-site-scripting attack is possible due to the unsanitised `cID` parameter in the preview_as_user functionality.

Example URL: `https://LOCAL-CONCRETE-INSTALL/ccm/system/panels/page/preview_as_user/preview?cID=%22%3E%3C/iframe%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E%3C!--`

The error is in the `concrete/views/panels/page/preview_as/frame.php` file, line 4:
```
[..]
src="<?= URL::to('/ccm/system/panels/page/preview_as_user/render') . '?&cID=' . Request::request('cID') ?>
[..]
```

Solutions would be to either cast this value to an int with `intval()`, or pass the value through `htmlentities()` before rendering it. Or both!

## Impact

An attacker could steal cookies or perform actions on other users behalf.
