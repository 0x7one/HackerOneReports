Summary:

Hi @jorgeleria,

I came across a potential reflected XSS vector while exploring **platform.harvestapp.com** functionality. At present, I have been unable to locate a functional payload, so would like to report this as HTML injection.

## Proof of Concept
### Steps to reproduce
1. Visit the below Demonstration URL
2. Select "Start Timer"
3. The "Namespace" error message will present the unsanitised HTML (a marquee)

### Demonstration URL
```
https://platform.harvestapp.com/platform/timer?app_name=TestCompany&closable=false&permalink=http://example.com/1/'"><h1><marquee>Test HTML</marquee></h1>&external_item_id=1&external_item_name=Test - Please click Start Timer
```

Please let me know if you require any additional details regarding this vulnerability.

Thanks!
