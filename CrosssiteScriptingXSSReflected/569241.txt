Summary:

Hi team ,
I found a reflected xss on https://app.oberlo.com domain .

##Reproduce :
* Visit **https://app.oberlo.com/auth?shop=%3C/noscript%3E%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=prompt(document.domain)%3E** in latest version of firefox browser .
* You will see popup like attacked screenshot : {F485407}

**Tested in Latest version of firefox**

## Impact

As this is a **auth** so this xss can lead to some serious issues like stealing users **auth** token or stealing browser data/cookies .

Best Regards
**Prial**
