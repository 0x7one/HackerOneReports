WeaknessName:Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected
Reporter:https://hackerone.com/zombiehelp54
ReportedTo:Shopify(shopify)
BountyAmount:2000.0
Severity:
State:Closed
DateOfDisclosure:29.05.2017 16:06:44

Summary:
This is a reflected XSS that could be triggered on the storefront of any Shopify store. Our template was missing proper escaping for the `theme_handle` parameter. This issue is severe because it could be exploited by unauthenticated users to attack the admin area of a store, given that the storefront is hosted on the same origin as the admin area of a store.
Hi,
I have found a reflected cross site scripting vulnerability in `<any>.myshopify.com` through `theme_hanlde` parameter due to not single quotes.

#Steps to reproduce: 
1. Navigate to `<account>.myshopify.com` 
2. view the source of the page and copy the value of `Shopify.theme` Id.
3. Navigate to `https://echo.myshopify.com/?theme_handle=xx%27-alert(document.cookie)-%27&style_id=1&style_handle=1&preview_theme_id=<theme_ID>` 
> *replace `<theme_ID>` with the ID you just copied*.
4. XSS will trigger in all of the online shop pages unless you click `Cancel theme preview` .

**PoC:** 
`https://test.myshopify.com/?theme_handle=xx%27-alert(document.cookie)-%27&style_id=1&style_handle=1&preview_theme_id=3572`
