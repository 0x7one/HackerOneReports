Summary:

Hi,

By injecting a crafted AngularJS payload into the `search` endpoint on the WordPress Swag Store, it was possible to achieve reflected XSS further to resolved report #221893.

I came across a potential exploitation vector after noticing that a search query for `{{2*2}}` returned `4` in the site title response.
