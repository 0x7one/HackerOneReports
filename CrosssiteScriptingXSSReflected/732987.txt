Summary:

Hi team,

I have found an XSS at https://bi.owox.com/ui/6177527534dc114eb07fa829e4ce4d28/dashboard/?trial=activated
Because the input is not properly filtered, resulting in XSS being executed
Vulnerable area: 
-----
``6177527534dc114eb07fa829e4ce4d28``
The URL will now be: https://bi.owox.com/ui/6177527534dc114eb07fa829e4ce4d28%3Cimg%20src=xss%20onerror=prompt('XSS')%3E/dashboard/?trial=activated

1, go to https://bi.owox.com/ui/6177527534dc114eb07fa829e4ce4d28%3Cimg%20src=xss%20onerror=prompt('XSS')%3E/dashboard/?trial=activated
2, Log in and ``XSS`` will execute
{F630101}

Tested browser
---
Firefox 
Chrome

## Impact

This vulnerability is aimed at all victims and they do not need to be involved in the ``Project``. Just paste this URL and login, XSS will automatically execute.
Therefore, it will have a ``high impact``, because before XSS is executed, the application will ask the user to login.
+ The attacker can execute JS code.

Recommendation
----
+ Revisit the entire application and validate the user input at server side.
+ Sanitize the data collected from input fields before further processing.
+ Filter out special and meta-characters from user input.
