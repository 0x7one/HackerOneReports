WeaknessName:Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected
Reporter:https://hackerone.com/low-keytech

BountyAmount:500.0
Severity:low
State:Closed

Summary:
While the reporter identified this as an HTML injection, during our investigation we confirmed this was actually an XSS vulnerability but would have required a target to copy and paste a payload themselves. We made an exception to reward this `self-xss` with our minimum bounty given this occurred on `accounts.shopify.com`.
Hi,
When I opened this domain of yours,
https://accounts.shopify.com/password-reset/new

I just put the following text into email address box,
<h1 style="color:blue;">harisbaig010@gmail.com</h1>
it change the colour of the text.

Well my point here is that if you could inject HTML, you might be able to add a <form> tag
to the page.
I also upload the picture as a proof.

Peace.
