Summary:

Hi there. I have found a reflected XSS in Zomato.com mobile. This XSS affects mobile users of Zomato. Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to Zomato.com and change your user agent to mobile *(iPhone/Android user agent)*
2. Go to a certain restaurant/place and their photos *(e.g. site: https://www.zomato.com/manila/artsy-cafe-diliman-quezon-city/photos?category=ambience)*
3. Change the value in the ```category``` parameter to an XSS payload: ```
"--><%2Fscript><svg%2Fonload%3D'%3Balert(document.domain)%3B'>```
4. Final URL will look like this: https://www.zomato.com/manila/artsy-cafe-diliman-quezon-city/photos?category=%22--%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Csvg%2Fonload%3D%27%3Balert%28document.domain%29%3B%27%3E

XSS will execute. POC attached.

Thanks and I hope you consider and fix this
