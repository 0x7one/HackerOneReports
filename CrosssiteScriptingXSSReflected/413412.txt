Reporter:https://hackerone.com/glc
ReportedTo:Chaturbate(chaturbate)
BountyAmount:800.0
Severity:high
State:Closed

Summary:

Hi,

I found a reflected XSS on the subdomain `secure.chaturbate.com` in the flash object `stm3.swf`.


## Description

In this subdomain you have a SWF object called `stm3.swf`, it can have several parameters. Unfortunately they are not not well sanitized and can be used to trigger a XSS.


## PoC

Visit the following link:
https://secure.chaturbate.com/iojs/resources/static/stm3.swf?globalNamespace=[document.domain]&partyNamespace=findIndex(alert)

{F350369}
{F350370}

## Impact

- hostile code insertion
- session hijacking
- user browser corruption

## Remediation

Check all parameters and encode special characters like ' " < >.
Do not pass parameters controlled by user to the function `ExternalInterface.call()`
