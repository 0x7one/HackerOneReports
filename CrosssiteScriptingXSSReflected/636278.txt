Summary:

I have identified a Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability on the m.olx.co.id website.

Vulnerable URL: https://m.olx.co.id/iklan/zundapp-1962-cafe-racer-250-cc-made-in-germany-IDA3GpU.html?ad_type=PL"><svg/onload=alert("XSS")><"

Vulnerable Parameter: ad_type

XSS Payload: PL"><svg/onload=alert("XSS")><"

Steps to replicate is fairly simple. Just access the URL and the JavaScript gets reflected in response and gets executed on the browser. The Popup screenshot attached.

Note: This seems similar to my other report: https://hackerone.com/reports/633751 just that the domain is different (m.olx.co.id).

Let me know if any further help is required from my side.

## Impact

1. Redirect user to malicious website like phishing website etc.
2. Rewrite the content of the current HTML page which can result in Brand Abuse.
