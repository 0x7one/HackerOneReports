Summary:
@nickcas discovered that it was possible to view all the team members of a program through a JSON response that is sent when a user is invited to collaborate on a report (via the `/invitations/<token>` endpoint). He was able to provide a very clear PoC, which consisted of a list showing all the members of the HackerOne security program. We resolved the issue by removing the unneeded information from the response in the case of collaboration requests.
