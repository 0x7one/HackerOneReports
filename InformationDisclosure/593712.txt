Summary:

I have found a Vulnerability in vanilla forums which called Web cache deception attack.

#Web Cache Deception Attack
Websites often tend to use web cache functionality to store files that are often retrieved, to reduce latency from the web server.

Websites often tend to use web cache functionality (for example over a CDN, a load balancer, or simply a reverse proxy). The purpose is simple: store files that are often retrieved, to reduce latency from the web server.
When accessing a URL like http://www.example.com/home.php/non-existent.css
A GET request to that URL will be produced by the browser.  The server returns the content of http://www.example.com/home.php. And yes, the URL remains http://www.example.com/home.php/non-existent.css. The HTTP headers will be the same as for accessing http://www.example.com/home.php directly: same caching headers and same content type (text/html, in this case).
The web cache servre saves the returned page in the server's cache. Then the attacker can go to the url: http://www.example.com/home.php/non-existent.css and the page of the victim will be presented with the victim's sensitive information (The page content).

The dangerous part in this attack, unlike phishing attacks, is that the url isn't looks suspicious at all.  It looks like a normal url from the original website, so the victim thinks that it is ok to click on the link.

Steps:
1. The attacker sends the following link to the victim: https://open.vanillaforums.com/messages/all/non-existent.css
2. The victim opens the link and the inbox page will be loaded normally. (The web cache server then saves this page)
3. The attacker open the same link (https://open.vanillaforums.com/messages/all/non-existent.css), and the inbox page of the victim with all his private contant is loaded.

If you need a video to understand it better, ask me and I will send you one.

## Impact

The attacker can achieve all the private content of a specific victim, without the victim knowing about it.
