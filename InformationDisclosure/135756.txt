Summary:

Hi ,
Deleted comments and rating of any app can be viewed by following url -

https://apps.shopify.com/<app>/reviews/<review-id>/edit

for example review with review id 47935 is deleted but still can be view by following link -
https://apps.shopify.com/swell/reviews/47935/edit 

As review id is incremental id so all reveiw of app can be collected easily.

It is not a big issue but deleted comment should not be allowed to view . Please let me know what you think about this .
Thanks
