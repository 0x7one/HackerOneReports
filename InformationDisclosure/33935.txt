Summary:

Hi guys,
I am kind of surprised no one hast reported this issue yet.
 (or maybe they have and due to the severity it was never patched?)

An example of this behavior would be:

https://hackerone.com//%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../etc/passwd  (which is a valid attempt even though we get an error saying file not found because..)

https://hackerone.com//%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../etc/passwd_DOESNTEXIST will rediredt us to a 404 page.


Let me know if you need more info from my end.

Thanks,
Ben
