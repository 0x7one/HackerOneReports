Summary:

Hi

as reported in email,
there is a full path disclosure in EasyDB

you fixed some of them in last commit
add this code before and "execute($params)" function call!

    if(count($params) != count($params,COUNT_RECURSIVE)){
                throw new \InvalidArgumentException("Invalid params");
    }

this will check $params to be 1d array,


Regards
