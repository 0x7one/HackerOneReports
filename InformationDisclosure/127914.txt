Summary:

Hey guys,

So this isn't really a security bug or a big information disclosure. However, I noticed that if a user removes their name "Eric Angeles" from their account page (https://hackerone.com/exodia_forbidden_one) it will still be visible by mousing over the users handle on a disclosed report (https://hackerone.com/reports/124975). So essentially this person has removed their name for whatever reason, *winks*, their name will still be displayed via this method.
