Summary:

Hi there,

I noticed a small information disclosure (full path disclosure) on ads.twitter.com.

#Steps to reproduce

- 1. Login to ads.twitter.com
- 2. Start to create a new twitter-follower campaign
- 3. Choose to upload a new picture
- 4. Turn on your intercepting proxy
- 5. Upload a file 
- 6. You should notice a request to your log facility.

```
GET /accounts/18ce53wparq/log?v=0.9&u=https%3A%2F%2Fads.twitter.com%2Faccounts%2Fxxxx%2Fcampaigns%2Fnew_objective%2Ffollowers%3Fsource%3Dobjective_picker&rt.start=cookie&r=https%3A%2F%2Fads.twitter.com%2Faccounts%2Fxxxxx%2Fcampaigns%2Fnew&timers=&events=ads%3Afollowers%3Acreative%3A%3A%3Aenter HTTP/1.1

The response will contain something like this:

```

```

As you can see, this discloses a full path to a resource. This information could be used in furhter attack scenarios like LFI or RCE. 

Please let me know what you think about it.

Best regards,
