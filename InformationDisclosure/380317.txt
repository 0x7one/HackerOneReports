Summary:

**Summary:**
Hello.

Similar to other reports, suddenly after the update with ordering users, the GraphQL API is exposing the amount of participants in a private program to non-invited users. This allows an attacker to retrieve the amount of participants in a private program, as well as their details.

**Description:**
Steps To Reproduce

Query, for example, ██████ via the GraphQL API. ██████ is known to have a private program running on HackerOne, and they do exist in the external directory.
```
query {
    team(handle: "█████") {
     participants { total_count  }
     about

}
}
```
You'll get the amount of participants, as well as their details if you query them. 
```
...
{ "data": { "team": {participants": { "total_count": 268 }, "about": "████" } } }
...
```

**Impact**

This leads to information disclosure. An attacker can expose the existence of a private program under the external program directory.

## Impact

This will eventually lead to information disclosure.
