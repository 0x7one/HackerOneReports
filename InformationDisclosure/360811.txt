Summary:

Hi,

After some research, I found a leak on GitHub that might lead to accessing sensitive data of employees or clients (not sure based on the code). There is also a SAP S-user to access a cloud based HANA service. I have not confirmed what kind of data is in there to avoid potential legal issues. I will let you guys figure that out ;)

I am not sure who is the owner of the repository, but I can tell you that the SAP credentials are for someone at Starbucks China.
