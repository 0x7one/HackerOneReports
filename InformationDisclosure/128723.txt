Summary:

Fyi, this is my second account since the other one (r0t) is limited to 4 reports and they are all in triage.

So about this issue, when a user is on a trip and invites other users to split the fare, the server responds with info about his number, like: Name, UserID and his picture, and info about the driver: DriverID and mobile number, and other info that is public.

Having this information, combined with other issues that we already reported (#127087, #127158, #127161), we are able to know lots of information about specific users. 

Ex: If we want to know a email address from a specific user, we could use this issue to know his userID and then use the issue #127158 to discover his email, or use issue #127087 to discover his trips.
