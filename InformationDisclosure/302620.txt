Summary:

**Summary**

Report pages contain <meta> tags that contains the description of the report. New browsers create thumbnails of recently visited pages that that display the content of the <meta description> tags. Since the meta tags contain the contents of report, private report contents are partially disclosed.     


**Description**

Modern browsers create thumbnails of visited pages along with the content provided in the <meta> tags.

It was seen that all private report pages contain <meta> tags with **description** attribute as the actual content of the report. When browser creates a thumbnail of this page, it also contains private content of the undisclosed program.
