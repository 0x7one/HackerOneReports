Hello H1 Security Team

#Description
In report #645264 and #669776, email title disclosure has been fixed in no content settings.
However, there is one more area which needs to be fix - "Instant bounty Award Email".
In this email, even though email settings have been set as "No content", still it's displaying Report Title.


#Step to Reproduce
+ Go to Program Email settings `/program_name/email_settings` and set email Settings as "no content".

  -X POST \
  -u "dummy:xxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @- <<EOD
    {
      "data": {
        "type": "bounty",
        "attributes": {
          "amount": 100,
          "reference": "aaaaa",
          "title": "SQL injection in example.com",
          "recipient": "example@example.com",
          "currency": "USD",
          "severity_rating": "high"
        }
      }
    }

```
+ In email, it's disclosing the Report Title even though Email settings has been set to "no content".
