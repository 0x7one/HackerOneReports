Summary:

By looking in the css of " olx.com.eg " i found that the logo src is linking to an external website
 https://olxegstatic-a.akamaihd.net/bd498cb-868/packed/img/2fc685b4081782d863b0c0c452ee54197b.png
this was so normal until i simply changed the url to just
https://olxegstatic-a.akamaihd.net/
I found then a full xml file that contains all the files hosted in this (cdn i believe) including important files like the ".htaccess" and the ability to easily download it and open all the content inside it
This vulnerability is dangerous because of it giving access to all the files on the cdn or this hosting platform
On the other hand , no html or php files were found which is great
