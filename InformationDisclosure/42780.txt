Summary:

Dear sirs.

Seems to have a vulnerability that exposed Web System information through the HTTP Headers Methods.

As a PoC run:

# nc -vv www.wnmlive.com 80
DNS fwd/rev mismatch: www.wnmlive.com != ec2-54-67-11-12.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
www.wnmlive.com [54.67.11.12] 80 (http) open
OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.wnmlive.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-transform

Expose information which let anyone know that Microsoft-IIS/8.0 with ASP.NET is running.

Also the Methods Allow: OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, HEAD, POST

Thank you for your attention.

Best Regards,
