Summary:

Hi,

I have discovered Vimeo's legacy API (`vimeo.com/api`) exposes private video titles.

Example URL: https://vimeo.com/api/oembed.json?url=https%3A//vimeo.com/152133387

Vimeo provides the uploader with 5 privacy options for viewing videos:

1. Anyone
2. Only me
3. Only people I follow
4. Only people I choose
5. Only people with a password

While "Only me" is selected the above URL will return `404 Not Found`. If any of the last three options are selected, the server will respond with:

```
{"type":"video","version":"1.0","provider_name":"Vimeo","provider_url":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/","html":"<iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/152133387\" width=\"352\" height=\"288\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"My secret video\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe>","width":352,"height":288,"video_id":152133387,"uri":"\/videos\/152133387"}
```

As you can see, this includes the title "My secret video". Given a URL of a private video, an attacker can view the title of the video which may in turn reveal the contents of the video. As video IDs increment one-by-one, it would be very easy to discover the titles of thousands of private videos by checking the response of the video page against the response of the API.
