Summary:

#Issue
During my testing I noticed that ubnt website `https://directory.corp.ubnt.com` seems to leak some data into internet. Wordpress directory `https://directory.corp.ubnt.com/wp-content/uploads/` is showing files which I suppose shouldn't be visible to internet. 

I noticed that these files include UBNT-employee email addresses (including personal?), pictures etc.

#Reproduction
Just open URL https://directory.corp.ubnt.com/wp-content/uploads/ and start browsing folders/files.
Most "juicy" stuff can be seen in these folders: ██████████
