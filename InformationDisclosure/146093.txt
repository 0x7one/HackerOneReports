Summary:

1. User Enumeration:
It is possible to enumerate four  WordPress usernames (jancborchardt, jos, lukasreschke, frank). An attacker can use these username to carry out brute-force attack in order to forcefully authenticate.

2. Akismet Plugin(2.5.0-3.1.4) vulnerable to unauthenticated Stored Cross Site Scripting:
This vulnerability allows an attacker to post a comment on a WordPress site which will execute javascript in the WordPress admin console. This is a typical XSS vulnerability pattern and one of the attacks it enables would allow an attacker to steal a WordPress administratorâ€™s cookies and gain administrative access to a WordPress website.

3. XML-RPC Interface available: The presence of xmlrpc.php can cause brute force amplification attack.
