Summary:

Hi, i have found several DNS records at Google DNS server 8.8.8.8 pointing to Uber local servers:

```
▶ nslookup logs.uber.com
Server:		8.8.8.8
Address:	8.8.8.8#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	logs.uber.com
Address: 10.6.0.1
```

```
▶ nslookup kerberos.uber.com
Server:		8.8.8.8
Address:	8.8.8.8#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	kerberos.uber.com
Address: 10.6.0.74
```

```
▶ nslookup ldap.uber.com
Server:		8.8.8.8
Address:	8.8.8.8#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	ldap.uber.com
Address: 10.30.14.3
```

This information could be used, if attacker gets SSRF,XXE,LFI etc in order to address local network of Uber.
