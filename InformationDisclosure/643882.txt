Summary:
The authentication of an staging environment wasn't working properly, allowing any combination of username and password to access the environment. Causing the leakage of a emailaddress-list.
**Domain and URL:**
[*.devmaximum.com]
[███████████.acc.devmaximum.com]

Hello,

I've found a couple hundred of devmaximum websites with personal datas. 

I know this subdomains are out of scope, i've discovered them with [devmaximum.maximum.nl]'s SSL certificate. But in less than 30 minutes of testing i've discovered 116 uniques ███.ln emails addresses, here is a sample:
████████

Maximum's developers are using admin:admin as main password to access the websites.

## Impact

There are many impacts possible, attackers can use this massive email record (there are ██████
active users according to the statistics) to forge user:password combinaisons, and login in in █████████.nl website.

And that's only the first developper's website, i have 344 record only with Sublist3r (subdomain enumeration tool).

So I have a question, do you want me to keep digging into this, or should I stop my tests ? If you want me to dig in further, can you please add the devmaximum.com domain in the scope ?

Thanks,

Best regards,

Sicarius.
