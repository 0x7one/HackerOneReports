Summary:
The researcher found an old marketing web application for one of our previous titles that was not properly decommissioned. As a result, an internal IP address and a set of DB credentials were being exposed. Fortunately, the database in question had already been decommissioned so the credentials being exposed were not able to be used anywhere.
