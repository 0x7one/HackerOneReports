Summary:
An issue was reported to us against the New Relic APM iOS app. Specifically, the issue was that the release version of the application contained some sensitive information, including internal email addresses and API keys. Versions newer then 3.20.3 released Aug 28, 2015 no longer contain this extraneous sensitive information.
