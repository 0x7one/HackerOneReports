Summary:
It was possible for a malicious power-up to modify it's communications with the Trello web client in a way that would cause itself to be misidentified as a different power-up.  This would potentially allow the malicious power-up to access the other power-up's private data, potentially including API tokens for other services (e.g. GitHub, Twitter, etc)

This issue was resolved by changing the protocol to make this sort of attack impossible.
