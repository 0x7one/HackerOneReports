Summary:

Hi team,

I wasn't sure if this worth a report, but I thought that you should be aware and HackerOne's support referred me to submit a report.

I ran into a diclosed report where the reporter asked to redact his email but we can still extract his email and more info about his google account from the JWT token.

The report: https://hackerone.com/reports/729960

The data from the JWT:
```
{
  "name": "Herald Big Deck",
  "picture": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mPrAtw3rhXQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdj1gqwV2ceXlY-7Ztz_RUQ-YcQ_A/photo.jpg",

    },
    "sign_in_provider": "google.com"
  }
