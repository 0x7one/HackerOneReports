Summary:

While playing around to access some private information on yelp.com i was able to get access to research papers on yelp which are not supposed disclose publically.

By framing a google dork i got access to most of your documents.
Google Dork: site:starbucks.com ext:doc | ext:docx | ext:odt | ext:pdf | ext:rtf | ext:sxw | ext:psw | ext:ppt | ext:pptx | ext:pps | ext:csv

Such important documents are getting indexed by google bots.

To mitigate this add below meta character so pages won't be indexed by bots.
<html>
<head>
<title>...</title>
<META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW">
</head>

Also you can disallow /html/ in robots.txt.

Hope will add these meta tags so that further no such documents will get indexed.

Thanks.
