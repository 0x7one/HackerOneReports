Summary:

Hi,
found another information disclosure vulnerability/Full Path Disclosure on your application.

Proof of Concept
-------------------------
GET  : https://www.localize.im/projects/[projiect ID/languages/[Language ID]
POST CONTENT: 
`CSRFToken=TOKEN&updatePhrases[previous][yxr][0]=&updatePhrases[edits][yy4][0]=&updatePhrases[edits][yxr][0]=&updatePhrases[previous][yxq][0]=&####LotsOfPhrases######&updatePhrases[secret]=[SecredCodes]&updatePhrases[translatorID]=[ID]`

Just Add "[]" after any of those *updatePhrases[edit][ID][0]* parameter.

Note: look like my last FPD Vulnerability report. doesn't it?
but last one was at *updatePhrases[previous][ID][0]* that is fixed as you rolled out a fix for that..
i just went to check that the bug is fixed or not and found there is another parameter that is still vulnerable.

### The information from page:
> **Warning: trim() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given in /srv/data/web/vhosts/www.localize.im/htdocs/index.php on line 192**

I Also Added a Screenshot of that FPD as attachment..
Thanks
