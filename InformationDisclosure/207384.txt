Summary:

While playing around to access some private information on newrelic.com i was able to get access to critical files which are not supposed disclose publically. i am able to download all archived files. 

Google Dork:site:newrelic.com intitle:index.of

Such important files are getting indexed by google bots.

To mitigate this add below meta character so pages won't be indexed by bots.
<html>
<head>
<title>...</title>
<META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW">
</head>

Also you can disallow /php_agent/ in robots.txt.

Hope you fix this soon.

Thanks.
