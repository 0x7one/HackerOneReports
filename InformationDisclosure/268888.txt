Summary:

Dear Twitter Team, 

While researching through one of your domain cards-dev.twitter.com i discovered that the host is disclosing sensitive information when a user browses to a specific directory  
https://cards-dev.twitter.com:443/keys/.

The application downloads a file json.json which discloses the following information
`"customer_key":"████"` 
`"customer_secret":"█████████"`
`"jira_password":"██████"`

I am checking that can this information be used to further escalate any vulnerability. 

Regards,
