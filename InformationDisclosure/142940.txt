Summary:

Sir,

I want to report a bug in your web which i have found in few minutes ago :)

I have registered In your website and i have found a upload option i want to upload some php files but its saying only .pdf file allowed so i have just change my (.php) file extension to (.pdf) first its saying not allowed its not a pdf file or file is corrupted... But when i try to upload it using post data i have successfully uploaded corrupted file 

here is my proof:

its a php shell 

if a attacker can change the value and successfully upload .php file using http request it can be risk for your webserver :)


Thanks
