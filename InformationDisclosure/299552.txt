Summary:

Hello,

I would like to report information disclosure on one of your sub-domains due to some files that might contain some useful information.

Basically i have found 3 files that might giveaway some information about the infrastructure :
1 composer.json
2 composer.lock
3 package.json

I found all the 3 files using dirsearch tool and location where these files can be found are :-
https://paycard.rapida.ru/composer.json , https://paycard.rapida.ru/composer.lock , https://paycard.rapida.ru/package.json 

If the subdomain is no longer in use then these files must be removed.

regards
sahil tikoo
