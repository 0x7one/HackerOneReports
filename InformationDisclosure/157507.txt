Summary:
The researcher @footstep found that the web server behind downloads.gratipay.com (nginx) is disclosing its version on error pages. However, this domain is hosted on a third-party infrastructure, MaxCDNâ€”making this impossible to fix and out-of-scope of our program.
Hello,

Navigating to http://downloads.gratipay.com/Error goes to a 404 error page disclosing your Nginx version. Server information should be protected since anyone with a bad intent on would try to find exploit for the specified server version.

Thanks,
Footstep
