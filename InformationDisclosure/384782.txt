Summary:
#Issue
The reporter found that user information leaked from www.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi.

##Fix

The issue was resolved during normal and scheduled hardening of Wordpress.

##Reasoning

The issue was valid and the reporter provided enough proof. This is typical Wordpress, what we know as a "feature", that every WP administrator should be aware of. 

We've had several reports on related issues, but as all were carried out differently we decided to award each separately.
## Basic report information
**Summary:** 
browser access to www.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi/wp-json is restricted for general public but it is still be accessible through which User information is leaked.

**Description:** 
By default Wordpress allow public access to Rest API to get information about all users registered on the system but you have restricted it internally. I saw several reports on this issue reported on lahitapiolarahoitus.fi. Now as a fix to those reports, requests to /wp-json/wp/v2/users are blocked and return an error like this:
> Refer to lahitapiolarahoitus.fi.JPG

It also successfully blocks requests such as /?rest_route=/wp/v2/users.
> Refer to lahitapiolarahoitus.fi1.JPG

However, the REST API allows simulating different request types. As such, we can perform a POST request with the “users” string in the body of the request, and tell the REST API to act like it’s received a GET request.

## Steps To Reproduce:

   > curl https://lahitapiolarahoitus.fi/?_method=GET -d rest_route=/wp/v2/users

## Browsers / Apps Verified In:

  * It is tested via curl command.
