**Summary:**

Hi Team!

On Team object the parameter "i_cannot_create_jira_webhook_reasons" is not NULL and gets the following default states when called for all programs ["CANNOT_VIEW","FEATURE_GATED","PROGRAM_PERMISSION_REQUIRED"]

If a Company Program runs a Private Program or a Public On the "FEATURE_GATED" is missing (Since the feature is not gated anymore) and therefore an attacker can find if a Company is running a private program

##POC

* Company ██████ (not runnig private gives "i_cannot_create_jira_webhook_reasons":["CANNOT_VIEW","FEATURE_GATED","PROGRAM_PERMISSION_REQUIRED"]

* Company █████████ (running private) gives "i_cannot_create_jira_webhook_reasons":["CANNOT_VIEW","PROGRAM_PERMISSION_REQUIRED"]

* Even Company HackerOne  (running public) gives "i_cannot_create_jira_webhook_reasons":["CANNOT_VIEW","PROGRAM_PERMISSION_REQUIRED"]

All private programs and public has an overriden  "FEATURE_GATED" so you get the idea

#Solutiion

NULL the value maybe

PS: Thanks to @jobert who encouraged me to search deeper after the #347383 duplicate!
