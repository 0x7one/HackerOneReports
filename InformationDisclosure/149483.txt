Summary:

Hi uber, maybe this is a low risk but i want to report that the __nginx__ and __openresty__ server version are being disclosed.

__For openresty:__ Accessing this url: https://chef.uberinternal.com/ will give you an error "502 Bad Gateway" but you can see on the page that the server version was disclose (openresty/1.9.3.1). See screenshot (openresty.JPG).

__For Nginx:__ When you go to this URL: __http://it-tools.uberinternal.com/__ , it will redirect to JetBrains but you will see in the response header that the __nginx/1.8.0__ version was disclosed. See screen shots (nginx_1.JPG and nginx_2.JPG)

It is important to keep secret of server versions. Similar reports here: #141125

Cheers
