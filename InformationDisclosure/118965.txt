Summary:

Hi! I would like to provide the following matrix in order to distinguish between EP+Private vs Private programs in HackerOne, without the need to login.

I am using two endpoints. These are:
1. https://hackerone.com/ENTITY/thanks/2012.json and
2. https://hackerone.com/ENTITY/thanks/2013.json

If ENTITY is SANDBOX the response in 1 is 401 and the response in 2 is 401
If ENTITY is EP the response in 1 is 500 and the response in 2 is 401
If ENTITY is EP+Private  the response in 1 is 500 and the response in 2 is 401
If ENTITY is Private the response in 1 is 401 and the response in 2 is 401
If ENTITY is Public the response in 1 in 500 and the response in 2 is 200
If ENTITY is User the response in 1 is 404 and the response in 2 is 404

As you may see from the above matrix, you can distinguish between EP+Private and Private programs based on the Return number.

Thanks!
