Summary:

Hi Team,

I got a error message that disclose the version of nginx with OS detail, since The version of nginx is vulnerable to integer overflow.
Impact:
By seeing this information attacker can throw only interger overflow attack in order to get sensitive information 
Finally Request you to remove those Information while throwing an error.

Note: I attached POC in the attachment.

Thank you.
