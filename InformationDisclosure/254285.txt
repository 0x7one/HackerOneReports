Summary:
This cool issue was about the memory leak. We mitigated it on July, 28 by limiting the size of "About" field.

Vulnerability based on unfiltered size of data in "about" field.
In case when data length stored in "about" field is more than 2^16 (for example payload is 65537*"A") server will return payload with additional suffix with random information. The size of suffix is increase with size of payload. Unfortunately I haven't detected the origin of the bug, but it`s look like chunks of memory. I hope, you will disclosure it for me in future.	

1. Request example:

POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: rapi.icq.net
Connection: close
Accept: */*
User-Agent: random
Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

{"method":"modChatAlpha","authToken":"[auth_token]=","clientId":6,"reqId":"[random]","params":{"sn":"000000000@chat.agent","about":"[payload with more than x^16 symbols]"}}

2. Suffix appears in Firefox/Chrome/Opera/Desktop client
3. Vectors:
	- gathering information from suffix, wich potentialy can disclosure critical service information or other clients private information.
	- stored xss, if intruder would have understand regularity of suffix appearing
4. Steps:
	1) Send request
	2) Suffix will automatically render itself in client(Firefox/Chrome/Opera/Desktop client - it return with updates). 

Exploit synopsis:
python expl.py [token] [payload size] [payload symbol] [client id] [chat_agent number]
