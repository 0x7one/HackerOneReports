Summary:
If an attacker installed a webhook on an team, and the team subsequently changed it's visibility from `private` to `public`, the payload sent to the webhook to notify it of the visibility change could potentially have disclosed some information that the attacker shouldn't have had access to.

For paid accounts, this could have included some limited information related to the payment account for the team:

- The name and email of the billing contact
- The type of card being used, and the last four digits of the card number

**We audited the webhooks that existed at the time that this bug existed, and determined that there were not any configured that could have received additional unauthorized information about a team** (other than the webhooks created by @theflofly to demonstrate the issue)  That said, the potential severity of the issue was high and warranted an immediate fix.
