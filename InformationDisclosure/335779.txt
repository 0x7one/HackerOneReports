Summary:
#Issue
The reporter found that user information leaked from www.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi.

##Fix

The issue was resolved during normal and scheduled hardening of Wordpress.

##Reasoning

The issue was valid and the reporter provided enough proof. This is typical Wordpress, what we know as a "feature", that every WP administrator should be aware of. Hardening was already in the pipeline, but as this was found before those were put in place the finding was processed. 

We had several reports on related issues, but as all were carried out differently we decided to award each separately ( #335779, #335341 and #326971).
