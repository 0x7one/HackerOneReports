Summary:
##Issue

The reporter found that the f5 Big-IP cookies potentially reveal BigIP pool name, backend's IP address and port, routed domain.

##Fix

There is an option in Big-IP to fix this. Just click, apply and you are done.

##Reasoning

The issue is not critical,but it was an easy fix. Note: we will apply this to all domains and no further reports on this for other domains will be accepted never ever.
## Basic report information
**Summary:** 
The Same issue was reported on www.myynti.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi by another reporter. It was fixed for that. But when I test the same issue on lahitapiolarahoitus.fi. It is also causing leakage of information.

**Description:** 
I just identify F5 BigIP load balancers and leaks backend information (pool name, backend's IP address and port, routed domain) through cookies inserted by the BigIP system.
