Summary:

Hi Team,

**Summary:**

First of all, i am not sure if a private program or any program have the capability to not show their response efficiency, __but i assume they have because i saw some private programs that do not show response efficiency percentage on their public page__.

**Description:**

Below list of private program was not showing their `response efficiency percentage` on their public profile, but using `profile_metrics.json` response, the percentage can be view resulting an information disclosure about the program.

█████████ = 100%
███████ = 100%
████ = 66%
████ = 68%
██████ = 52%

### Steps To Reproduce

  1. Go to ██████████
  2. Observed that response efficiency was not visible
  3. Now go to █████████/profile_metrics.json
  4. I can confirm that `66%` is the percentage of ██████████ because of this `"response_efficiency_percentage":66`


## PoC screenshot below:

███████

## Impact

Information disclosure despite the private program is not showing the response efficiency percentage.
