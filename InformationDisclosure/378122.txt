Summary:

Hi There,
### Steps To Reproduce

1- open this site: https://www.virustotal.com/#/domain/hackerone.com 

-------------------------

2- Then Go down to the end of this page and you will see this:

████

``https://hackerone.com/reports/334677?invitation_token=███████``

--------------

3- when i open it, i see this:

█████

---------------------

4-after the step 3 i thought it's demo from hackerone to learn us the invitation process so i found the report is valid and it contain a valid issue to ████.


--------------------------------

5-clicked on accept will lead to open this: ██████

**You have been invited to manage the report submitted to ████.**
██████████



-----

6-Now after the step 5 I was shocked and i stopped my self from doing any things else because it's just one click to **manage** the report ;)

## Impact

I was able to manage a report for ███████ program:

1-Close the report as spam or resolve or any things
2-Public disclosure of this report 
3-Discredit the ████ team by comments with unprofessional reply.
4-i will see  **internal comment** between hackerone staff there too.

Best,
