Summary:
The finder found a vulnerability that allowed them to determine the available bounty balance of some programs. The endpoint that awards a bounty did a balance check before the authorization check and returned an error when the program had insufficient funds. Someone could iterate over all report IDs and try to award a number of bounties to narrow down the balance. The program names were only accessible for public programs. This vulnerability only affected a limited set of our customers.

We'd like to thank @cyriac and @cjlegacion for bringing this vulnerability to our attention!
