Summary:

Hello Leaseweb
It's my same report but it's for different web application  http://leasewebnoc.com
here is sever version disclosure in  http://leasewebnoc.com as when I have request about .htaccess , that returns result of forbidden but following server version publicly disclosure.
                  Apache/2.2.22 (Debian) Server

So it's important to keep secret of server version.

Thanks,
cyber warrier
