Summary:
The researcher discovered that the SSO endpoint for oauth2.razerzone.com, which is a web API server for our Razer ID architecture, did not properly validate the origin header of the caller.  This would allow any caller to obtain a user's access token, which combined with other techniques, could allow the takeover a user's account.

The report was clear and thorough and included a solid PoC.  We appreciate the efforts of the researcher and look forward to working with him again in the future.
