Summary:

Hey,

I noticed when monitoring the websocket requests that the account information of many users, including email address, is sent to the client. For example:

```
██████

██████████

█████████

████████

███████

```

There's hundreds of these requests, each containing user information. Please let me know if this is meant to be happening, but I didn't see a list of users on the site.
