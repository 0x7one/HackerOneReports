Summary:

New relic provides user's the option to register new accounts. It was observed that during creation of new account process, user's password is displayed in clear text in response.

This leads to disclosure of passwords.

There may be another issue here that user's passwords are not stored in hashed format in database. However, I can not comment on that based on response. As the password may just be reflecting in response.

Please refer the screenshot as well.

Recommendation please ensure that user's password is not visible in response.
Do no store password in clear text, always store the passwords as hash.
