Summary:

I found that the domain images.gratipay.com is just a reverse proxy for gratipay.com and **HTTPS** works throughtout the site flawlessly except in one case, that it when we try to open user's profile:

POC: https://images.gratipay.com/~asdlfz/

Https Warning Page: http://i.imgur.com/XHsXJEvr.png?1


**Risks**

Any user browsing the page is under direct man-in-middle attack, as Https is being not implemented properly, The session data can be easily decrepted via any end point.

For new user's it might result like first impression of the site is an invalid https certificate and plus the warning Chrome gives is way more horrifying:

>Attackers might be trying to steal your information from images.gratipay.com (for example, passwords, messages, or credit cards).

The user might never dare to open even gratipay.com ever.


**Fix**
Add a valid Certificate across `images.gratipay.com` or remove the domain at all.
