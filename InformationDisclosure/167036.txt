Summary:

Hey,

I have noticed that the 404 Not Found page of apiok.ru shows Ngnix server version!
This may b a Low Risk But If the attacker came to know about the Server version he can gather some public exploits of that server version & perform his malicious attacks.

Similar Report: #141125

Link where the Server Version is been disclosed.
