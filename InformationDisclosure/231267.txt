Summary:

Hello,
I found an **Sensitive Information Disclosure**.
A configuration file (e.g. Vagrantfile, Gemfile, Rakefile, ...) was found in this directory. This file may expose sensitive information that could help a malicious user to prepare more advanced attacks. It's recommended to remove or restrict access to this type of files from production systems.

#POC
https://go.pushwoosh.com/composer.json
https://go.pushwoosh.com/composer.lock

Open these URLs a configuration file will become download and these files contains very sensitive data.

###IMPACT:
These files may disclose sensitive information. This information can be used to launch further attacks.

###PATCH
Remove or restrict access to all configuration files accessible from internet.

Thanks,
