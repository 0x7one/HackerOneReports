Summary:

Hi,

Using Gmail it is possible to get the list of email addresses that use/have coinbase accounts. 

as a prerequisite: we will need a script to bruteforce a list of email addresses. consider this script:
```python
import random
#values only contain small letters and numbers
letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789'
def generateWord():
        letter = ''
        for i in range(12): #all possisble values are 12 in length
                letter += random.choice(letters)
        return letter
#add all possible values to list
file = open("wordList.txt","a")
counter = 1;
while True:

        try:
                #avoid duplicates
                generated = generateWord()+"@gmail.com;
                file.write(generated)
                print counter,"words Generated so far"
                counter++;
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
                break 
```
That script will generate all the list of emails that can be created with *a-z+0-9*. this can easily be used with a dictionary bruteforce attack to generate more realistic emails like dave.egor@gmail.com (note: this is actually pretty much doable with a much powerful botnet who multi-thread this and give back the list of emails). 

Then we will add these contacts to our Google Contacts (google.com/contacts), then ask Coinbase to import contacts to invite. (https://www.coinbase.com/invite_friends). after Coinbase imported our contacts, it tries to provide a **feature** to tell if an account already have a Coinbase account or not. (see screenshot)

Its pretty much known most people who use Bitcoin are those who want to hide their real identity. but by using this trick, it is to know the user list. I believe this is some sort of Duplicate of some issue because you probably taught of this, or not. but anyway, I am going to propose a way to fix it

**Recommended Fix:** if a user is already a member to coinbase, the person who is inviting them doesn't need to know that. if he/she is already a member, the person inviting will see them as a normal email and will still see, "Invite Sent". but in the background, invite for memebers won't be sent and for non-memeber will be.

Thanks,
P
