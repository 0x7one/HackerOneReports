Summary:

Hi,

as reported in #115337
about a full path disclosure in EasyDB

you fixed some of them in last commits
but `single` function is vulnerable too and not fixed yet!

    if(count($params) != count($params,COUNT_RECURSIVE)){
                throw new \InvalidArgumentException("Invalid params");
    }
this will check $params to be 1d array,
add this code before line 366 in EasyDB.php


Regards
