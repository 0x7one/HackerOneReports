Above you can see server version of Nextcloud [Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)]


This information might help an attacker gain a greater understanding of the systems in use and potentially develop further attacks targeted at the specific version of Apache.

Impact
An attacker might use the disclosed information to harvest specific security vulnerabilities for the version identified.

Remediation
Configure your web server to prevent information leakage from the SERVER header of its HTTP response.

I hope you'll fix it!

I think and hope this report would impress you.
