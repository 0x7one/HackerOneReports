Summary:

An ajax script on the main okcupid.com domain allows an attacker to set an arbitrary callback function name, allowing exploitation of the [Rosetta Flash](https://miki.it/blog/2014/7/8/abusing-jsonp-with-rosetta-flash/) vulnerability to steal any data from the victim's account. Note that the vulnerability exploits an issue with Flash which was fixed in 14.0.0.176, however many users have yet to update.
