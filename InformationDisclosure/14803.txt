Summary:

Dear Sir,

I've Noticed from your SourceCode that you are using HTTP Protocol, and that will makes Insecure served for data transition.

we will give the attacker a chance for "MIMT" ( man in the middle attack) as you know that the name of the attack itself explain the steps.

-check the source code of the main page.

Solution: try to use https protocol, to prevent data and information disclosure.

Best,
