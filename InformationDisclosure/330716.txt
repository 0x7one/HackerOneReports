Summary:
##Issue

The reporter found that the f5 Big-IP cookies potentially reveal BigIP pool name, backend's IP address and port, routed domain.

##Fix

There is an option in Big-IP to fix this. Just click, apply and you are done.

##Reasoning

The issue is not critical,but it was an easy fix. Note: we will apply this to all domains and no further reports on this for other domains will be accepted never ever.

## Basic report information
**Summary:** 
The remote host for myynti.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi is appears to be an F5 BIG-IP load balancer(or behind load balancer) and the unencrypted cookie may disclose BigIP pool name, backend's IP address and port, routed domain.

**Description:** 
The remote host appears to be an F5 BIG-IP load balancer. The load balancer encodes the IP address of the actual web server that it is acting on behalf of within a cookie. Additionally, information after 'BIGipServer' is configured by the user and may be the logical name of the device. These values may disclose sensitive information, such as internal IP addresses and names.

As you can see, when i'm testing with curl, it will show like this
```
< Set-Cookie: BIGipServermy██████████oitus-fi_pool=2079████████6.0000; path=/
< Set-Cookie: TS013d0012=0147052ac538e5a096f03ce792d4dfca4fa7aa1446dea5089d1317f68b65cec609e178c83e1b5a758b8525b5d28fa72da9dc462362; Path=/
```

**Impact:**
Attacker can leaks backend information (pool name, backend's IP address and port, routed domain) through cookies inserted by the BigIP system.

## Browsers / Apps Verified In:

  * Metasploit

## Steps To Reproduce:

  For this case, you can use metasploit auxilary module to scan vuln:
```
use auxiliary/gather/f5_bigip_cookie_disclosure
set RHOST myynti.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi
run
```

## Additional material

  * I've attaching screenshot in this report

```
msf auxiliary(gather/f5_bigip_cookie_disclosure) > run

[*] Starting request /
[+] F5 BigIP load balancing cookie "BIGipServermy█████oitus-fi_pool = 2079██████████6.0000" found
[+] Load balancing pool name "my██████oitus-fi_pool" found
[+] Backend 19█████████2:81 found
```

## Remediations

  * Encrypting the cookies from BigIP : http://www.systemadvise.com/2016/11/f5-big-ip-cookie-remote-information.html
