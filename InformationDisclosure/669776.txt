Summary:

**Summary:**
It is somehow related to this report #645264. But I found an alternative way to reproduce the issue even it is considered as resolved.



### Steps To Reproduce

1. As a Program admin, navigate to ```Program Settings``` 
2. Click ```Program```
3. Click ```Email Notifications```
4. Make sure it is set to ```No Content```
5. Go to any report in your program and invite any hacker to the report.
6. Notice that the contributors email will receive an email WITHOUT REPORT TITLE (SINCE IT IS ALREADY FIXED)

### Steps To Bypass the #645264
1. Go to the report that you added to the contributor’s email ( step 5 )
2. Participants section then hover on the invited contributor’s email. ```SELECT REMOVE PARTICIPANT```

3. Hackerone will send another email that the invitation has been revoked. But notice that the email sent disclosed the Title that supposed to be mask.

{F550179}

## Impact

Even thou #645264 is considered as resolved and fixed has been implemented, there’s still a way that it the Notification Settings is not totally fix since it still send email with Title that supposed to be mask. I know you will think that “ but the contributor is already remove so it is not an issue” the fact that it disclose information that supposed to be not is considered a bug. What if the Title contains confidential information like type of attack and the domain?

I hope you get what I mean, if you need more information, please let me know 

Thanks,
