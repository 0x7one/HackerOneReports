Summary:
Currently OLX is working on the mitigation of this vulnerability. All API endpoints are being reviewed by dedicated resources and fixed under high urgency. 
Hi,

Through api-v2/items you can list all information of users (except email). As items are sequential, you can just make a script that crawls items from:

https://www.olx.com.ar/api-v2/items/822200000
to
https://www.olx.com.ar/api-v2/items/901858309

Example of sensible user information from random curl:
```
██████████
```
```
█████████
```

Example of random curl: 
```
$ curl https://www.olx.com.ar/api-v2/items/822200000
██████████
```

Let me know if you need anything else.

Cheers,
Luke.-
