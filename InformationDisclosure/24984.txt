Summary:

Summary of the issue:


The auth_parse_options function in auth-options.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 5.7 provides debug messages containing

authorized_keys command options, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain potentially sensitive information

by reading these messages, as demonstrated by the shared user account required by Gitolite. NOTE: this can cross

privilege boundaries because a user account may intentionally have no shell or filesystem access, and therefore may

have no supported way to read an authorized_keys file in its own home directory.

OpenSSH before 5.7 is affected.

Attack details..:

According to its banner, the version of OpenSSH installed on the remote

host is older than 5.7:

ssh-2.0-openssh_5.5p1 debian-6+squeeze5
