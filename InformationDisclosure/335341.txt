Summary:
#Issue
The reporter found that user information leaked from www.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi.

##Fix

The issue was resolved during normal and scheduled hardening of Wordpress.

##Reasoning

The issue was valid and the reporter provided enough proof. This is typical Wordpress, what we know as a "feature", that every WP administrator should be aware of. Hardening was already in the pipeline, but as this was found before those were put in place the finding was processed. 

We had several reports on related issues, but as all were carried out differently we decided to award each separately ( #335779, #335341 and #326971).
**Summary:** 
It's possible to get information about the users registered (such as: id, name, login name, etc.) without authentication in Wordpress via API on www.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi. 

**Description:** 
By default Wordpress allow public access to Rest API to get informations about all users registered on the system. 

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. It's possible to reproduce the attack by browsing the URL:
https://www.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi/?rest_route=/wp/v2/users/1
https://www.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi/?rest_route=/wp/v2/users/2

  2. Just increase the last number of the Endpoing of API  (/?rest_route=/wp/v2/users/{id}) to get all users registered information on the Wordpress

**Remediation:** 
There are 2 ways that it's possible to fix this problem.
**FIX 1** - It's possible to remove this access for anyone by change the source code where when someone request the Rest API and the server send a 404 (Not Found) message for the user who made the request. 
Reference: https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/issues/2338

**FIX 2** - It's also possible to create a rewrite rule on .htaccess (if the webserver it's Apache) to redirect any request that contain rest_route (eg.: "^.\*rest_route=/wp/\*") to a Not Found (404) or a Default Page.

## Impact

It's possible to get all the users registered on the system and create a bruteforce directed to these users.
