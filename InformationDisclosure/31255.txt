Summary:

A readme (or read me) file contains information about other files in a directory or archive and is commonly distributed with computersoftware. Such a file is usually a text file called README.TXT, README.md, README.1ST, READ.ME, or simply README, although someMicrosoft Windows software may occasionally include a README.WRI, README.RTF, or README.DOC. The name is chosen so that users unaware of the existence of this type of file would be drawn to read it. It is traditionally written in upper case so that on case-preserving environments using an ASCIIbetical ordering, the name will appear near the beginning of a directory listing (since upper-case letters sort before lower-case letters in ASCIIbetical ordering)..

# Localize

We believe that everybody should be able to use software in their own language.

Localize takes care of all the background work. You can concentrate on great apps and perfect translations.

Invite staff members to collaborate with assigned roles, let users contribute and export translations in seconds.

> If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.
> â€” *Nelson Mandela*

and one thing more 
https://www.localize.im/.htaccess

it is showing Forbidden

You don't have permission to access /.htaccess on this server.



The error is generated when there is no index file in the requested
directory and the server or application is not configured to reveal
the directory contents. This, however, indicates that the directory
exists.

If the server is unable to find a file with any of the names listed in
its configuration, it may either return an error (generally 404 Not
Found) or generate its own index page listing the files in the
directory. It may also return a 403 Index Listing Forbidden. Usually
this option is also configurable
 

solution:-

To  resolve  this  error  you  have to  Edit .htaccess file

Please clean  the  file  and  add the  following  code

RewriteEngine on

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
