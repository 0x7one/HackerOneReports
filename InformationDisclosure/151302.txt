Summary:

Hey, I've captured the HTTP request while visiting assets.gratipay.com

**_The whole HTTP response is as following_**:
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: assets.gratipay.com:443
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch, br
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8

```

So as you can see that the "server: NetDNA-cache/2.2" is showing the NetDNA-cache server and version!

I hope you'll fix it!

Note: If you are not going to fix this one, please close this as informative! :)
