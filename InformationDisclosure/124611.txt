Summary:

Hay again ,

We know that there are some companies have "external" page on HackerOne :
https://hackerone.com/directory?query=type%3Aexternal&sort=name%3Aascending&page=1

Some of those companies are hosting private programs as well , (with the same handles)

We can pick up any program from the external programs list , and find out if it hosting a private program or not , by applying this 

https://hackerone.com/<program_handle>/thanks 

If it returned 200 OK statue with the thanks page of demo programs with demo thanked researchers , then it's hosting a private program on HackerOne {F79965} .

I think it's the same as #116029 minus the activities disclosure part , which obviously pumped up his bounty :D

Thanks,
