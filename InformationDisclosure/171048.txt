Summary:

Hello Security team,

Request: if you think the reported issues have acceptable risk and you are not going to make changes then kindly request to mark as Informative or let me close it.

I'm not sure if this is the normal behavior of the page, but i thought i would be a good idea reporting to you guys.

I took a look at http://corporate.olx.ph source code and found some javascript code returning some interesting information from the server. Its even possible to see some sql structure. I also looked at other's olx.ph subdomain but they don't return those information in the same way as http://corporate.olx.ph does.

Again: if you think the reported issues have acceptable risk and you are not going to make changes then kindly request to mark as Informative or let me close it.
