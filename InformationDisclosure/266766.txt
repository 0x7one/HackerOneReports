Summary:
A publicly accessible analytics database instance was identified, due to a firewall misconfiguration.

The instance contained booking related information but did not contained any passenger or driver personal information. This vulnerability was discovered using Shodan search engine by **Vinoth Kumar**. Grab security team quickly resolved the issue and awarded the researcher based on the impact. 

Once again we would like to thanks @vinothkumar. It was a pleasure to work with and we look forward to see more of his reports in the future.
