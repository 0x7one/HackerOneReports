Summary:

Hello,
I found a Sensitive Data Exposure in github/mopub-android-mediation project, the AppLovin UI API key is hardcoded in source code. 

And in the comment it's mentioned that 
##"This is a unique SDK Key from AppLovin. Get yours from the AppLovin UI".

Github Link:- https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-mediation/blob/72804166ec9f3b79cc0dcfa96bd8c813f3252794/Testing/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L60

## Impact

So if it's a production API key then it shouldn't be shown publicly in Github repo otherwise it can be used by other developers as it's a company property the API key should be secure as it's a monetize API key.
