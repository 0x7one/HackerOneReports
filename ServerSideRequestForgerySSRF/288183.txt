Summary:

##Description
The SSRF fix can be bypassed, using domain, pointed to the AWS IP `	169.254.169.254`, like `metadata.nicob.net`.

##POC

##Suggested fix
While there is no 100% way to validate the domains using only string-based checks, you should resolve domain-to-ip, and then check IP against local ranges.
