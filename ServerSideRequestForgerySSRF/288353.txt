Summary:
In this report, the researcher found that by submitting crafted SVG files, he was able to establish a listener on our server that enabled SSRF attacks. This potentially could have been pivoted to carry out more damaging attacks as well. We improved our validation of user-submitted SVG files to prevent this from happening in the future.
