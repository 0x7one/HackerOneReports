Dear GitLab bug bounty team,

# Summary
---

It appears as though the fix to [!17286](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/17286) can be easily bypassed. You have blocked the usage of `http://127.0.0.1`, `http://localhost/`, etc., but `http://0177.1/` and `http://0x7f.1/`, for instance, can still be used to scan internal ports.

~~~
Error importing repository http://0177.1:22/ into {username}/{project} - Cloning into bare repository '[REPOS PATH]/{username}/{project}.git'...
fatal: unable to access 'http://0177.1:22/': Recv failure: Connection reset by peer
~~~

Admittedly, you have restricted the use of certain ports, but I still believe this needs to be fixed.

# Fix
---

Block decimal, octal and hex localhost notation.

Best regards,
Ed
