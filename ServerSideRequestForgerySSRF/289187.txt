Summary:

Hello there, this is for the otx.alienvault.com domain, but I couldn't mark it in the drop down menu. I saw the note about the 2 weeks so I decide to report this.

**Summary:**
I've found that you can perform a SSRF attack(with DNS pinning) and read the response from url http://169.254.169.254

## Browsers Verified In:
* Firefox 56.0

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Open URL: https://otx.alienvault.com/otxapi/indicator/hostname/http_scans/lol3.1ynrnhl.xip.io
or URL: https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/hostname/lol3.1ynrnhl.xip.io
  2. You can see the response from the 169.254.169.254

Note: Please change the URL from lo3 to lol4 etc, because the URL needs to be different for every request.
