Summary:

##Description
The latest SSRF fixes can be bypassed, using octal encoding of the AWS IP.
There is other more general bypass, which can't be fixed using blacklisting - it's reported in the #288183.

##Suggested fix
As was mentioned in the #288183,
there is no 100% way to validate the domains using only string-based checks, the best way to protect yourself - it's resolve domain-to-ip (or get A record), and then check this IP against local ranges (to prevent also localhost/local environment querying).
