Hello,

I noticed that your subdomain corne.maximum.nl links to the website "maximum.com" instead of "maximum.nl" ("maximum.com" is in control of a Chinese organization as you said in your description).

I think you've made a little mistake, but there is no impact :)

Have a nice day !

Best regards,

Sicarius.

## Impact

Nothing really fancy, just improper redirection !
