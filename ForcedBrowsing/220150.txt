Summary:

Hello,

My investigations revealed that we have accesible directory in forbidden directory:

http://www.ubnt.com/static/ - forbidden
http://www.ubnt.com/static/cm/ - forbidden
Here we have http://www.ubnt.com/static/cm/mode/ accesible and then /xm/l and /django/ foders

POC:
http://www.ubnt.com/static/cm/mode/ - 200 http code (accesible)
http://www.ubnt.com/static/cm/mode/xml/ - 200 http code (accesible)
http://www.ubnt.com/static/cm/mode/django/ - 200 http code (accesible)

Now, i didn't looked up very close to this pages content, but for sure we are not supposed to acces them. Thank you.

Kind Regards.
