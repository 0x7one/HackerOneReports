Summary:

Hello, 

I just found some minor issue with RSA 2048 bits (SHA1withRSA) in b5s.hackerone-ext-content.com and a4l.hackerone-ext-content.com thru Qualys SSL Labs and wanted to report it.

Proof of Concept

Result: SHA1withRSA   INSECURE
https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=a4l.hackerone-ext-content.com
Result: SHA1withRSA   INSECURE

I hope you will fix this issue.

Cheers,
Evan
