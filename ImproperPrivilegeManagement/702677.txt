Summary:
The tester discovered that a THX server known primarily to THX employees was exposing several hundred records containing customer email addresses and in very few cases, a personal name.   No other information was revealed. This issue was fixed shortly after the report.

We appreciate @smalien's diligence in helping THX protect its customer data.
