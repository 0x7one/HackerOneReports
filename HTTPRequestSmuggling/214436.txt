Summary:
Submitter observed that CloudFlare-protected sites will serve content from other CloudFlare-protected sites when the "Host" HTTP request header is modified in transit.

A PoC for an attacker to modify a victim user's "Host" HTTP request header could not be presented by the submitter; consequently this issue is considered non-exploitable.

This behavior does not meet the definition of HTTP header injection, since the request's content does not determine the content of the headers in the HTTP response. Reference: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Response_Splitting
