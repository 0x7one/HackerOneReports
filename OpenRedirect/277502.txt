Summary:

Hi,

In a similar manner to #228569, it is currently possible to execute authenticated open redirections via the `wp_http_referer` parameter used in the [BuddyPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) extended user edit screen.

## Proof of concept

Upon accessing the below URL, please select the "Update Profile" button, then select the "**‚ÜêBack to Users**" link. This will redirect a target to the attacker-specified address (in this case, "google.com").


```
http://instance/wp-admin/users.php?page=bp-profile-edit&wp_http_referer=https://google.com
```
