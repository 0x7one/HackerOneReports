Summary:

**Summary:** 
protocol & Ports are not shown in third-party site redirect warning page 

**Vulnerable Endpoint :-** https://www.semrush.com/redirect?url=ftp://evil.com:1337

**Description:** 
I noticed #311330 this report where you guys fixed a open redirect report by adding a external third-party site redirect warning page . It was a great fix . Although a issue caught in my eye . Urls contains a **protocol** and **Ports** . If I add a url with any other **protocol** like **ftp://** then it's not shown in the external warning page what can be used to take a user to any other place then user expected to go  .

## Browsers Verified In:
  * All Browsers .
## Steps To Reproduce:
* Visit https://www.semrush.com/redirect?url=ftp://evil.com:1337
* You will see a warning page only saying about the domain but no warning about the **protocol & Port** like below :- {F387701}
* But the source says it will take user to **ftp://evil.com:1337** not only **evil.com**

```
<a href="ftp://evil.com:1337" id="js-site-link" class="site_link" data-test-site-link="">
Go to site </a>
```
## Supporting Material/References:
* {F387701}
* {F387702}

## Impact

I noticed in **url=** parameter many protocols can be used . Like I can use **vnc://** protocol and on my mac os if I visit **https://www.semrush.com/redirect?url=ftp://evil.com:1337** and click on **Go to site** then it will open my mac environment's default VNC app like below screenshot :-
{F387702}

So while user may think they will visit a site but actually they will request to a site with a protocol what may take them to anything else .

##FIX :-
I can suggest 2 possible fix here :-
* Show the  **protocol & Ports** of the inputted url in the Warning page .
* Or only allow users to add **HTTP & HTTPS** protocol .

Thanks .
