Summary:

Hi,

It is currently possible to execute an open redirection attack via the `next` parameter with the inclusion of a triple-slash prefix.

## Proof of Concept
### Redirect URL
```
https://demo.weblate.org/accounts/login/github/?next=///google.com
```

After authenticating, the user will be immediately redirected to the attacker-specified target.  I believe this affects all third-party authentication providers on the Weblate platform.

Please let me know if you require any additional details regarding this vulnerability.

Thanks!
