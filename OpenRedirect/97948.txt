Summary:
(This is similar to #97191)

If the following conditions are met…

* You are an admin of a demo team
* And you click a malicious link provided by an attacker
* And you are social engineered into interacting with the displayed dialog
* And you are using a browser that doesn't support `Content Security Policy` (such as Internet Explorer)

… then a same-origin policy violation could occur.
Hi,

Two weeks ago, I found a Cross-domain AJAX request, but due to the fact that you uses a very strict Content Security Policy, I hesitated to send this. Today, I noticed that bug has been fixed. But this fix can be bypassed.

This example not working now (screenshot 1):

But if will be (screenshot 2):

or https://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=%2Fhackerone.com.google.com


It's will work.
