# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

When processing extensionless html, hekto launches a redirection.

```
//https://github.com/herber/hekto/blob/master/bin/hekto.js#L184
      // Add trailing slash for extensionless html.
      if (fs.existsSync(file + '.html') && fs.lstatSync(file + '.html').isFile()) {
        this.status = 307;
        this.redirect(this.request.url + '/' + query);

        return ;
      }
```

For example, if there is a file named "hackerone.com.html" in document root dir, accessing `http://<server>/hackerone.com` will leads to a redirection to `http://<server>/hackerone.com/`.

But when accessing `http://<server>//hackerone.com`, the server would redirect ro `//hackerone.com`.


## Steps To Reproduce:

1. install hekto module
`$ npm install hekto`

2. create a file named `hackerone.com.html`
`$ touch hackerone.com.html`

3. run server from command line
`$ ./node_modules/hekto/bin/hekto.js serve`

4. test redirection

```
$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:3000//hackerone.com
HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect
Vary: Accept-Encoding
