Summary:
Vulnerability Details:
Appointment titles are rendered as hyperlink but were missing a protection against "tab nabbing".

Risk:
When following a hyperlink to a malicious website, the original tab location (OX App Suite) could be replaced with a URL chosen by the attacker. This can be exploited to trick users to re-enter credentials to a seemingly legitimate website and as a result take over accounts.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a appointment invitation that contains a link to a malicious website including a blank "target" attribute
2. Make the user accept the invitation and click the hyperlink at the appointments title
3. Provide a effective exploit to overwrite the users original URL and fake a login page

Proof of concept:
Appointment title content: 
<a href="//www.evil.com/window.html" target="_blank">Click Me! :-)

Payload:
<script>
window.opener.location.replace('//www.evil-fakelogin.com/');
</script>

Solution:
We extended the usage of existing protection mechanisms (blankshield) to this case.
