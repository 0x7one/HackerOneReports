Summary:

Hello,
Domain : login.newrelic.com
Endpoint  : https://login.newrelic.com/login?return_to=[URL]

Description : There is a protection against open redirection at this endpoint, so an attacker can't redirect an user to any external website using following  : 

https://login.newrelic.com/login?return_to=http://attacker.com/ [Won't work] 

It won't work due to existing protection. But this protection is very weak and can be bypassed using following payload : 

https://login.newrelic.com/login?return_to=http:///@attacker.com//localhost 
https://login.newrelic.com/login?return_to=http:///@attacker.com//newrelic.com

Any of above both links will redirect user on http://attacker.com after getting logged in or directly if already logged in.

Impacts : Attacker can redirect user on any malicious website.

Mitigation : Use more stronger protection at this endpoint.

Best regards,
Shailesh
