Summary:

An attacker can use an open redirect vulnerability in the Twitter OAuth process to redirect someone to his/her webpage, while also obtaining the OAuth token and verifier of the victim. 

The vulnerability is right here: https://app.respond.ly/_oauth/twitter/?requestTokenAndRedirect=https://hackerone.com. When someone authorizes their Twitter account using that URL, the redirect will go to https://hackerone.com.

Recommendation: make sure the `requestTokenAndRedirect` paramater only accepts hosts on whitelisted domains.
