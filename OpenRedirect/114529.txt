Summary:
@hussain reported a content spoofing and local redirect issue in Mapbox Studio in February 2016. Strings passed to the `message` query string parameter on requests to `https://www.mapbox.com/studio/forbidden/` would write text directly to the page. 

@hussain combined the content spoofing issue with a redirect via the `redirect` query string parameter. We were not able to reproduce an open redirect, though a local redirect to other pages within Studio did exist. We were also not able to replicate the injection of CSS in Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox that @hussain reported.

Ordinarily we would not award a bounty for separate individual reports about content spoofing, social engineering, or local redirects, but we awarded the minimum bounty in this case due to the following factors:

* effective proof of concept that combined social engineering, content spoofing, and local redirect in a believable exploit
* relative ease of social engineering via sharing a URL
* change to our codebase and subsequent deployment
