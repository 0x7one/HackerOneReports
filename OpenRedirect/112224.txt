Summary:

Hi Mail.ru,

I was surfing in your website and i was trying to find a Reflected Cross-site Scripting Vulnerability , So i was trying to find a way to inject my payload in a LINK .

While Surfing i've found this link : https://pw.mail.ru/validate/index.html?ref_url=pw.mail.ru 
> Screenshot : http://i.imgur.com/3GIieDr.png

And i was wondering :
>How could pw.mail.ru needs a verification from the Captcha BOT ? 
>If it needs a verification , all of the domains needs verification and  it should be a DESIGN Issue .

So i tried to change the "?ref_udr=" parameter from "?ref_udr=pw.mail.ru"  to "?ref_udr=google.com" , and i was expecting a block for this Parameter but the surprise is it didn't blocked and it gives me the same CAPTCHA interface which i saw in ?ref_udr=pw.mail.ru

So i have writed the captcha and redirected with any problem to google.com
