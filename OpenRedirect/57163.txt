Summary:

Hello!

I would like to report about open-redirect on hackerone.com

Here is the PoC that redirects to example.com IP address: https://hackerone.com/%2F1572395042

There is one more strange behavior in URL. For example:
https://hackerone.com//hackerone.com - works
https://hackerone.com//hackerone1.com - doesn't work

I will investigate it further and get back with details if I find something more.

Thanks!
