Summary:

There seems to be an open redirection on Uber.com

When a user uses `https://www.uber.com//google.com/cities` it will lead to a `Page Not Found` on the Uber website but if the google.com is changed to an IP address such as `https://www.uber.com//216.58.217.206/[param]` it will lead to either a 404 or an SSL error depending on what kind of website you are trying to reach.
But remove the `https://` and now you will be able to reach any website with the IP address. `uber.com//216.58.217.206/calendar` will redirect to Google's Calendar without any of the SSL error or 404 error.

Also for an hyperlink to be activated the attacker can send the URL `http://uber.com//216.58.217.206/calendar` (changing the https -> http)

Proof of Concept:
A user can be sent a URL link that can lead to malicious content. The user will believe the link is trust-worthy because it still has the name of Uber.
