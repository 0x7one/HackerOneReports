Summary:

Hi Team,
I have discovered an Open Redirect vulnerability affects logged-in users within the following parameter:
https://account.my.com/login_continue/?continue=

It seems like you allow only the URLs end with ```my.com``` which can be obviously bypassed using the listed methods :- 
- https://account.my.com/login_continue/?continue=http://3xr.me%5Cmy.com/
- https://account.my.com/login_continue/?continue=//notmy.com *any Domain ends with my.com*

Regards,
