##Summary:
There is wrong interpretation of URL encoded characters at `https://twitter.com/safety/unsafe_link_warning` endpoint which could lead to different location then what is supposed to.

Although it shows warning but doesn't show warning about punny code characters.

##Description:
On following characters:

```
%E2%80%AE - RTLO Character
%E2%80%8E - LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK
%E2%80%91 - Non breaking hyphen
%E2%80%A9 - PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR
%E2%80%AA 0 Right-to-left embedding
```
Interpretation of these characters is different but when we click continue button it will redirect you to some other location.

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. Go to following URL: https://twitter.com/safety/unsafe_link_warning?unsafe_link=https%3A%2F%2F%E2%80%AEmoc.rettiwt
2. You will see that its showing : https://twitter.com

But originally you will be redirected to https://xn--moc-4t7s.rettiwt/ when you click continue button.

##Argument:
> But it is not possible to have TLD 'rettiwt'.
* counter:
We can have URL as follows:
```
https://twitter.com/safety/unsafe_link_warning?unsafe_link=https%3A%2F%2F%E2%80%AEmoc.rettiwt.com
```
