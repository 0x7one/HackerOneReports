Summary:

Hi,
URL: https://mobile.twitter.com//example/messages (there is double slash before "example" word)
when you click "send" after writing a message the authenticity_token will send to https://example
this URL doesn't allow any dots in it, so i can not write //example.com 
but when i write a number it will redirect me to an ip, 
EG:
https://mobile.twitter.com//0/messages
>> 0.0.0.0
when i write a longer number it will redirect me to another ip
i fount this website that can change server or a website to ip
https://www.site24x7.com/find-ip-address-of-web-site.html
then i fount this website that can change any ip to a single number (without dots)
http://www.smartconversion.com/unit_conversion/IP_Address_Converter.aspx
so i'll change http://example.com to an ip by the first website
http://example.com = 93.184.216.34
now i'll change 93.184.216.34 to a single number without dots by the second website
93.184.216.34 = 1572395042
now to redirect from twitter to example.com
https://mobile.twitter.com//1572395042/messages
Thank you!
