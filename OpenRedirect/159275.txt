Summary:

Hi,

It seems ReturnUrl in the Starbucks authentication page have a strict checking on the URL that should be redirected if a user successfully login or cancel the request.
However, this ReturnUrl parameter can be bypassed to redirect user into another page by using backslash and slash character.

As example, I do this in latest Firefox browser. Where by browsing below URL, when a user click on Cancel, it'll redirect to http://x
``https://www.starbucks.ca/account/forgot-username?ReturnUrl=/\x``

Attached the animated POC for your reference.

Also it is noted that ReturnUrl does not properly filter the user's input. There's a probability to perform XSS in this parameter such as below code:

``https://www.starbucks.ca/account/signin?returnUrl=//xxxxxx" onclick%0b="prompt(0)``

However, I've not able to show the triggered popup yet as for the time being.
