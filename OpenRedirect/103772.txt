Summary:

Hi,

Any user after logging into an any myshopify shop can be redirected to other domain.

To reproduce:
Send this to victim: 
http://sehyoginfoshop.myshopify.com/account/login?checkout_url=.np

Now when our victim logs in,
He will be redirected to
https://sehyoginfoshop.myshopify.com.np/

Which is not a shopify domain.

Fix: While redirecting Use <shop-name>"/"$checkout_url instead of <shop-name>$checkout_url
