Summary:
Links with `hackerone.com` domain were treated as trusted links, including those followed by `/zendesk_session`. Anyone can create a custom Zendesk account that redirects to an untrusted website and provide it in `/redirect_to_account?state=` param; and because Zendesk allows redirecting between accounts without interstitial, you'd be taken to the untrusted site without any warning. 

Given that the origin of the issue is within Zendesk, we've chosen to identify the links with `zendesk_session` as external links which would render an external icon and an interstitial warning page when clicked. 
Hi guys , I have found a way to use the open redirect vulnerability that zendesk refused to fix and we discussed it in #101146 to bypass intristial redirect. 
in #101146 , @bencode said : 
> I tend to agree with Zendesk, we don't really see any security issues with it. We use our interstitial to warn the user and it's clear you are on a separate site.

Well , using this issue I could bypass the interstitial redirect.
#PoC:
[Clicking here will bypass interistial redirect and get you on evil.com](https://hackerone.com/zendesk_session?locale_id=1&return_to=https://support.hackerone.com/ping/redirect_to_account?state=compayn:/)
 
The link is `https://hackerone.com/zendesk_session?locale_id=1&return_to=https://support.hackerone.com/ping/redirect_to_account?state=compayn:/` which is used to redirect to generate a zendesk session.
This can be fixed from your end , by detecting the `/ping/redirect_to_account` in the `return_to` parameter. 
Thanks
