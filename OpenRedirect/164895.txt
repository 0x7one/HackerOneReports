Summary:
##Issue

The reporter found a vulnerability that allowed open and unvalidated redirects. 

##Fix

A fix was issued for the application.

##Reasoning

*"Unvalidated redirects and forwards are possible when a web application accepts untrusted input that could cause the web application to redirect the request to a URL contained within untrusted input. By modifying untrusted URL input to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts may have a more trustworthy appearance."* (OWASP)
