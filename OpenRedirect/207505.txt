BountyAmount:
Severity:
State:Closed
DateOfDisclosure:10.11.2017 22:26:54

Summary:

Affected host: `alerts.newrelic.com`
Affected resource: `/auth/newrelic`
Affected GET parameter: `origin`

#### PoC:

1. Go to `https://alerts.newrelic.com/auth/newrelic?origin=.example.com`
2. If you don't have an active session, you'll need to login with your New Relic credentials
3. You'll be taken to `https://alerts.newrelic.com.example.com`


#### Description:

The `origin`parameter is used by the web application to redirect the user to a specified resource by appending its value to the end of this string: `https://alerts.newrelic.com`. This allows attackers to redirect New Relic users to domains they control (in this case `example.com`). This can be leveraged to phish a customer's sensitive information. Please also note that if the user is already logged-in, he'll be immediately taken to `https://alerts.newrelic.com.example.com`.
