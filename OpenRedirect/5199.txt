Summary:

Using a proxy tool such as Burp, set the Target as https://coinbase.com.
Then, send the following request:

GET /cdn-cgi/l/chk_jschl HTTP/1.1
Host: coinbase.com
Referer: http://attacker.com
Content-Length: 2

Notice the attacker's domain in the Referrer header. This value is not being validated on the server side and as a result, the user is redirected to http://www.attacker.com

Attack Scenario:
1. An attacker hosts his own website www.attacker.com.
2. He has a link on this website https://coinbase.com/cdn-cgi/l/chk_jschl.
3. The attacker tricks a legitimate coinbase user to click on this link.
4. When the user clicks on the link, he gets redirected to the attacker controlled website.
5. Now, if the coinbase user is authenticated to the coinbase website in the same browser, all the cookies from the browser are sent to the attacker controlled website.
6. The attacker now has access to the user's session cookies which he can use to impersonate the coinbase user and take complete control over the user's account.
