Summary:
The tester discovered the deals.razerzone.com website was vulnerable to open redirect via the rurl parameter (e.g. https://deals.razerzone.com/user/sso_login?rurl=<some-other-URL>) and that the parameter was also vulnerable DOM-based XSS.

Also, the initial fix for this was a little too specific and edio was able to clarify for the team that the issue was not fixed in full.

We would like to acknowledge edio's hard work - edio really deserves twice the reputation on this one.
