Summary:
On September 1st, 2016, @n0rb3r7 reported a vulnerability in the [Mapbox Classic editor](https://www.mapbox.com/editor/) related to a known `window.opener.location.href` issue with user generated content and cross origin navigation when `target="_blank"` (see [HTML bug report](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=28821)). This was addressed via the creation of the `noopener` link attribute (see [whatwg PR](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/290)) and browser compatibility efforts are ongoing. As of now it is has [limited support](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#link-type-noopener), though there are open tickets for adding it to the majority of remaining browsers.

After an internal review of the issue- taking into consideration previous reports similar in nature, browser compatibility progress towards making `noopener` the default, the level of effort necessary to attempt this exploit, the bandwith required for patching it, as well as the fact that Mapbox Classic editor is a legacy product- we decided that we would not move forward with an immediate fix at this time.

This report was well put together and looking into it helped us further our research on this vulnerability type, thank you again @n0rb3r7!
**Description**
I have a script running on my server which gives me full control over a visitor's window object. This allows me to replace the user's legitimate mapbox.com session with my own Mapbox phishing form (not live). As you can see from the proof-of-concept video below, this vulnerability works cross-origin. This is an extremely effective phishing vector and should be remediated ASAP. 

**Video PoC:** {F116642}

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Navigate to my map at https://www.mapbox.com/editor/?id=chasemiller5.19coghk8#data
2. Click on my website link in the description (http://chasemiller.me/hax/mapbox_test.html) 
3. This should open the link and change the user's legitimate mapbox.com session to my malicious Mapbox login phishing page (not active) (behavior may vary slightly between browsers).

**Mitigation:**
This bug can be easily mitigated by using the 'noopener' link type. This sets the 'window.opener' property to 'null'
