Summary:

**Summary:**
Hello,

Domains can be spoofed on redirect page using RTLO. 


**Description (Include Impact):**

Using  `http://username@domain.com` & `RTLO` method, i found a way where redirect page host detection can be spoofed

#Steps
 1. Insert this on report  `[Just Click Here](https://google.com@%E2%80%AE@moc.rettiwt)`
2. On click of link, it will redirect to `/redirect` page . Here you will see that `Twitter.com` is highlighted domain. see screen shot below
3. Ideally, if there is any malformed url, it shows some kind of warning but not in this case.
4. Click on `Proceed` button and you will be redirected `https://moc.rettiwt/` instead


### Browser version, Device, etc
Tested on chrome for Mac but should work in all browsers
