Summary:

Hello,

**Endpoint:** https://hackerone.com/users//saml/sign_in?email=teste@snapchat.com&remember_me=true

Recently, you have patched an open redirection issue which was reported as #171398. 
I found a bypass of that patch. 

**Steps to reproduce:** 
1. Add following in comment/report : 
```https://hackerone.com/users//saml/sign_in?email=teste@snapchat.com&remember_me=true``` 
2. Click on link. 
3. You will redirected on SSO URL without going through **External Link Warning** page. 
4. Done.

PoC  : 
https://hackerone.com/users/saml/sign_in?email=teste@snapchat.com&remember_me=true (Through external warning page)
https://hackerone.com/users//saml/sign_in?email=teste@snapchat.com&remember_me=true (Without external warning page)

**Suggested Fix:** Use more stronger regular expression and filtration at this endpoint.

Best regards,
Shailesh
