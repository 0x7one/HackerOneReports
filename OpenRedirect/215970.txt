Summary:

Hi,

While experimenting with Repository Import functionality on a fresh GitLab 9.0 CE install, I noticed that the `continue[to]` parameter can be used to perform an Open Redirect through the inclusion of a double-slash prefix. 

## Proof of Concept
The following Proof of Concept URL enables a malicious actor to execute this redirect against any user – as long as they have permissions to view a certain repository. 

```
http://<instance>/<user>/<repository>/import?continue[to]=//google.com
```

## Observation
I first noticed the `continue[to]` parameter while receiving the `You're not allowed to make changes to this project directly` message – demonstrating that edit-level access to the repository in question is not required.

Thanks!
