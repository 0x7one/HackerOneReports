Summary:
It was possible to provide a URL starting with `../` and redirect to a page on the same domain. This was not intended so we decided to fix the issue even though it had minimal security implications.
Hey,

I have noticed and redirect hidden field in admin/staff login page so I though give it a little shot! 

What happened another user create a Shopify page with bad javascript code in it.

and when any user or owner login with following traversal URL he/she will be redirected to bad js containing a page with any intentional.

"https://capripio.myshopify.com/admin/auth/login?redirect=../pages/about-us"

I am well aware of the following description on your bug bounty page.
"Any issue where a store administrator is able to insert javascript in the storefront area of their own store, including the checkout pages."

But I think security issue is greater here as you were aware of above statement so it might be dangerous to redirect someone to a bad page on a front store, so I submitted.
