Summary:
To allow documentation pages to provide convenient links to shops' admin pages, requests to `https://www.shopify.com/admin/*` redirect the user to `https://<shop-name>.myshopify.com/admin/*`, where `<shop-name>` is filled in based on the value of the `last_shop` cookie.

Because input validation was missing, any `last_shop` value would be accepted, thereby allowing an open redirect to any domain.
