Summary:

None of the weakness categories really fit this so I apologize for that.

The subdomain `sales.mixmax.com` points to `151.101.16.229`, a `webflow.io` proxy server. Because it 404s, this leads me to believe that a subdomain takeover is possible through the webflow service as whatever this is pointing to is unused. 

Due to odd DNS configurations I'm not 100% sure on this but thought I'd make you aware just in case.
