Summary:

Hello guys

I don't know if you care about this issue but it seems that the export feature in your https://vault.bitwarden.com/#/tools is vulnerable to CSV injection. If a CSV contains a malicious command it may have big impact

Even though there is a popup notification for users before opening the CSV but due to it is coming from bitwarden site. User might trust the CSV.

I provide a video demo to show how the issue was found

Attack
-------
If the data inside the CSV if from other users then this might be a big impact. attackers will insert malicious command.

Im using this excel command
@SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0

Fix
---
Prefix =, +, - and @ symbols with a ' in issues when exporting them to a .csv file might do the tricks.
