WeaknessName:Memory Corruption - Generic
Reporter:https://hackerone.com/guido
ReportedTo:OpenSSL (IBB)(ibb-openssl)
BountyAmount:500.0
Severity:
State:Closed
DateOfDisclosure:27.03.2016 23:33:14

Summary:
Severity: Low

The internal |fmtstr| function used in processing a "%s" format string in the
BIO_*printf functions could overflow while calculating the length of a string
and cause an OOB read when printing very long strings.

Additionally the internal |doapr_outch| function can attempt to write to an OOB
memory location (at an offset from the NULL pointer) in the event of a memory
allocation failure. In 1.0.2 and below this could be caused where the size of a
buffer to be allocated is greater than INT_MAX. E.g. this could be in processing
a very long "%s" format string. Memory leaks can also occur.

The first issue may mask the second issue dependent on compiler behaviour.
These problems could enable attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is
passed to the BIO_*printf functions. If applications use these functions in this
way then they could be vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses these functions when
printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data. Therefore applications that
print this data could be vulnerable if the data is from untrusted sources.
OpenSSL command line applications could also be vulnerable where they print out
ASN.1 data, or if untrusted data is passed as command line arguments.

Libssl is not considered directly vulnerable. Additionally certificates etc
received via remote connections via libssl are also unlikely to be able to
trigger these issues because of message size limits enforced within libssl.

This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 and 1.0.1.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2g
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1s

This issue was reported to OpenSSL on February 23rd by Guido Vranken.  The
fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team.
