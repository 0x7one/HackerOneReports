Summary:

Copy Paste of bug report at https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=71020
Issue verified and fixed.

Description:
------------
This is a vulnerability is in the function Collator::sortWithSortKeys. The vulnerable code is in ext/intl/collator/collator_sort.c

1) Given an array, each element (hashData) is being referenced by a pointer in sortKeyIndxBuf[sortKeyCount].zstr (line 493):

414: hash = Z_ARRVAL_P( array );
...
425: ZEND_HASH_FOREACH_VAL(hash, hashData) {
....
493: sortKeyIndxBuf[sortKeyCount].zstr = hashData;

2) The array is then destroy and it's hashData elements freed (ref count -1):
508: zval_ptr_dtor( array );


3) Note that at this point sortKeyIndxBuf[sortKeyCount].zstr still contain pointers to the hashData elements which has been freed. In essence, sortKeyIndxBuf[sortKeyCount].zstr  are dangling pointers.

4) A new array is reinitialized,
510: array_init(array);

5) The dangling pointers are then added as elements into the new array:
515: zend_hash_next_index_insert( Z_ARRVAL_P(array), sortKeyIndxBuf[j].zstr);



6) I've included a POC that triggers this  vulnerability, The POC can be obtained via: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5y9azo01hvflzug/collate-UAF-Poc.php?dl=0

		-an array of 0xbb elements is being passed into the function
		-sortKeyIndxBuf[0].zstr to sortKeyIndxBuf[0xba].zstr points to the elements in the array
		- Array is destroyed via zval_ptr_dtor( array );
		- sortKeyIndxBuf[0....0xba].zstr are now dangling pointers
		- New array initialized (Hashtable with initial element size of 8)
		- As the dangling pointers are added to array, the size of the Hashtable grows.
		- As the Hashtable grows, it's allocated more memory via zend_hash_do_resize()
		- It will then be allocated memory that co-incides with an address pointed to by the dangling pointer sortKeyIndxBuf[j].zstr. Thus sortKeyIndxBuf[j].zstr now no longer points to a valid zval.
		- When the code below dereferences this address, because it is pointing to an invalid zval, it will access dereference whatever is the value within this "corrupted zval". In this case it's a null pointer dereference. 
		  514:Z_TRY_ADDREF_P( sortKeyIndxBuf[j].zstr );

This bug seems to have been introduced in this commit: Bug introducted in https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/4fbaddb4f8b041769bea7efdd12313641387bd14
Only php 7 is affected.

According to their developer:
stas@php.net
Putting this in public before the release probably wasn't the best idea, as this could be exploitable if the sortable data is user-controlled.
