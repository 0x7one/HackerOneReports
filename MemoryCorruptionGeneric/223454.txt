Summary:

Hi there

#Vulnerability Title:
>During my regular testing, I have found that there was no restriction on the amount of text that can be inserted into a user's Full name field.
 
#Security Impact:
>When the text size was large enough the service  resulting in a momentary outage in our non-production environment (not high-availability). An internal reproduction showed isolated disruption but no outage in our production environment.

#Mitigation:
>To mitigate, please restrict limit of user input field of Full name like you have already enforced on the fields E-mail and User name. 

If you need more info, be free to ask.


Happy to help.
