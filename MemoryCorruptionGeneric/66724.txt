Summary:

I haven't actually spent much time on the bug, because it doesn't look super exploitable outside of a local DoS, but the attached PoC will crash sassc in the middle of libsass from latest git, trying to deref $0x8, which appears to be the value of some tag in a tagged union.

Let me know if I can help chasing this down, but I mostly wanted to just punt it over the fence.
