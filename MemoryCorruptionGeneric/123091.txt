Summary:

Hello,
there is no rate limitation on entering "promo code" while upgrading the subscription.
an attacker can bruteforce the promo code and could get a lot of benefits with that.

https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/XXXXXXX/products

i have tested this bug by attempting 500+ invalid promo code.
and got the same json response on every request.

{"info":null,"error":"Promotion \"XXXXXXX\" was not found"}

A simple fix for this issue is that you should use captcha implementation after 5-6 invalid attempts, to prevent the bruteforce attacks from this vulnerability.
