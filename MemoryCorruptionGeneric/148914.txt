Summary:

Hey, I've found a session management issue in CMS Airship [bridge.cspr.ng]

Issue
----------
[*] When the password of an account is changed from a session, other sessions doesn't expire!

### Steps to Reproduce
[+] We Need to use two broswers

1. Login to one browser
2. Login to second browser
3. Then change the password from one browser.
4. After changing the password, go to other browser, the session will still be alive

- That means, server-side session not expire after password change.

How to Fix?
---------------
Server-side session should expire after password is changed from one session, or it should ask (either logout from other devices/browsers OR don't destroy the session [Like facebook does when changing password])

I hope you'll fix this soon! :-)

Thanks,
