Summary:

The following code produces a segfault without causing a stack overflow, affecting the sandbox:

    def fn(n)
        return
        ensure
            if n == 0
        else fn(n-1)
        end
    end
    fn(24)

When the `n` parameter is less than 24, there is no segfault. However,
investigating with a memory sanitizer shows that uninitialized read errors
start to happen when `n >= 15`. The uninitialized read happens at the following
location in vm.c (with the relevant line marked):

```
1701         cipop(mrb);
1702         acc = ci->acc;  [***]
1703         mrb->c->stack = ci->stackent;
```

The issue seems to be in using the `ci` data after the call to `cipop`. The following patch stops the read errors and segfaults, and passes make test:

```
