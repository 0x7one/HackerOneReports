Summary:

Hi,

Just pulled the latest mruby code, and found that some of my fuzzing test cases now crash. Bisected it to commit `227daa881137d5251e03eea0883b9b574a1f064e`. Reverting this change no longer causes a crash.

The minimised file causing the crash is:

```
f ()
```

Also affects mruby-engine.

Cheers,

Hugh
