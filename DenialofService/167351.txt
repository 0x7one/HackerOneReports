Summary:

Hello Eobot,
I am able to sign up on your web application using a long 100000 characters password which may lead to website becoming unavailable or unresponsive.
Usually this problem is caused by a vulnerable password hashing implementation. When a long password is sent, the password hashing process will result in CPU and memory exhaustion.

Normally all sites have a password minimum to maximum length like 72 words limit or 48 limit to prevent Denial Of Service attack.
Please verify and reply me back if you find this a issue a risk threak.
Thanks,
Gopesh Sharma
