Summary:
@davidrenardy discovered that the ZXCVBN algorithm is quadratic in time complexity, which implies that the user can submit an arbitrarily long password to the library, leading to a potential denial of service attack if performed at scale.

Given how ZXCVBN is used at Dropbox, we accept the Denial of Service risk that this represents.

As released, zxcvbn is intended to be implemented client side. Dropbox recommends that any organizations using our open sourced libraries server side consider and implement controls to prevent these types of attacks.
