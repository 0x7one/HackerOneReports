### Summary
based on the documentation gitlab markdown is supporting math expresion rendering using `KaTex` and able to run subset syntax from `LaTex` this could be achieved by using 2 ways in the markdown for inline and for multiline.

### Steps to reproduce

Step-by-step guide to reproduce the issue, including:

1. Pick any repositories that you want to attack
2. Create new issue and use payload [1.md](https://gist.github.com/abdilahrf/959d75c5d39034ebc411844316a7ce4c#file-1-md) or [2.md](https://gist.github.com/abdilahrf/959d75c5d39034ebc411844316a7ce4c#file-2-md)
3. Everyone trying to open the issue will get hang since this generate tons of resources

### Impact

Project owner/everyone that trying to view the issue is got hang by the `KaTex` trying to render nested `sqrt` function without any limitation and making the owner unable to close the issue.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

I was able to using nested sqrt and rules function without any limitation and making the website unresponsive

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

The nested function should be limited using fixed normal amount, and should use `maxSize` to limit the visual width/height

### Output of checks

https://gitlab.com/abdilah.pb/testing-project/issues/2

### Remediation

Use maxSize option for preventing large width/height visual affronts, use maxExpand for preventing infinite macro loop attacks, and use allowedProtocols for preventing certain protocols in \href. Please refer to Options for more details. [https://katex.org/docs/security.html](https://katex.org/docs/security.html)
