Summary:
It was possible to create a webhook that pointed to the EC2 metadata address, http://169.254.169.254.  While no data from that address would be returned, the webhook *would* be created successfully (with a `200` status), indicating that proxy used by the webhook requests wasn't blocking access to that address.

The actual vulnerability was low (the only data returned was a status code) and access to all other internal systems was already blocked.  We did however modify the proxy configuration to also block the EC2 metadata address.
