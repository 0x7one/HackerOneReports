Summary:
##Issue

The reporter was able to craft an http-request to request a CAPTCHA-image with arbitrary size. The image was generated on the server, leading to excessive load for large-sized images. 

##Fix

The dimensions of the CAPTCHA was limited server side.

##Reasoning

The flaw was very simple and even simpler to exploit, but the potential business impact was significant. Very much a stealthy DOS potentially hard to pinpoint. The bounty reflects the potential business impact.

## Basic report information
**Summary:** 
It is possible to generate a simple request which creates a high cpu/bandwidth consumption from the server by abusing the captcha servlet

**Description:**
By sending a specially crafted request and changing the height/width parameters in the captcha form it is possible to consume large amount of cpu/memory and bandwidth.

By Sending a width 21800 and height 4800 the server responded after a few seconds with a payload of 318k.
When increasing the height to 48000, the server responded after about 15 seconds with a payload of 3M.

Testing was stopped in order to prevent a full denial of service on the website but it seems that there is no limit and easily with a couple of requests we can deny service to the servlet and maybe even the whole server.

**Domain:**

## Browsers / Apps Verified In:

  * Chrome / CURL

## Steps To Reproduce:

(Add details for how we can reproduce the issue)

  1. Send a request to the following url - http://viestinta.lahitapiola.fi/nms/jsp/captcha.jsp?captchaID=@vq-ooKP6OECsEZDMwxvQGKYlOO5cUAx8hD9Z856vdHI=,122&width=21800&height=4800&minWordSize=8&maxWordSize=8
  2. Increase the parameters width and height until server gets unresponsive or under heavy load


## Remarks

In the scope of testing I saw that denial of service is out of scope, This attack is more applicative and doesn't use distributed denial of service methods and I think it is important for you to fix this although it is not in scope
