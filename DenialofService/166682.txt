Summary:

Hey there,

When selecting an image at `https://keybase.io/_/api/1.0/image/set_preference.json`, passing an invalid value in `identity_src` knocks the server down for 20-30 seconds, with just one request. I have verified this by visiting an external website that checks if a website is down.

POC:

1. Connect either your twitter or github account with Keybase.
2. Select to edit your profile image, and select one of the images.
3. Repeat the request, such as in BurpSuite. Pass in a value to replacing `identity_src`. To prevent keeping the server down, I have only tried two values, `1043` and `http://google.com`. The server will error with 503 and will be down for 20-30 seconds. I have attached a screenshot from http://downoruprightnow.com/ verifying that the site is down.

Please let me know if you need any more information.
