POC

Copy in {F82766} TXT file (all) and create a new review 
I warn you , if you do this , then the report cannot open .

You can create a report , attach files and replace my files F82764 and F82765 , paste in the contents of the report and create it

Why is it a security bug ?
I answer , if I get an invite to report to someone , I may make it available to all


P.S EXAMPLE html inside <code> in markdown
