Summary:

We can arrange for C to call `Object#send` by aliasing it over `initialize`. This will cause `Class#new` (a C function) to call `#initialize` (which is actually `Object#send`) with arbitrary arguments.

If we invoke a Ruby method through `Object#send`, mruby segfaults:

```
def foo
end

class X
  alias_method :initialize, :send
end

X.new.send(:foo)
```
