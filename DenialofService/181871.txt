Summary:

Overwriting the 'new' method of the NoMethodError singleton to not return an exception object leads to memory corruption and possibly arbitrary code execution.

Running the following code under the mruny-engine sandbox script results in a native crash:
    NoMethodError.define_singleton_method(:new) do "waat" end
    Object.q

Attached is a patch to mitigate the issue.
