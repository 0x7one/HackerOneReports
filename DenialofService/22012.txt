Summary:

Hi, team .
I found that password reset link sent by twitter is not validated.

Description: 
When a user ask for password reset link at two different times, say at 12.00 PM and at 12.03 PM.
Then he is able to change his password using either of the link.
Here the previous token is not expiring as soon as a new one is generated.
Which means  a link generated at 12.00 PM can also be use to change  the password.
For better securtiy previous token should get expired or should be invalidated as soon as new link is generated for that user.

POC:
1) Ask for reset link 2 times
2) Change the password using first link.
3) There you go , it's possible and previous link is valid to change the password.

Fix: invalidate the previous token or link as soon as a new token or link is generated.

If any further information required please let me know.

Thanks and regards.
