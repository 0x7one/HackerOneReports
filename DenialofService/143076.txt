Summary:

Hi Uber , 

I would like to report an issue on the domain http://m.uber.com
Upon testing some back and forth requests to this domain , I figured out that it is possible to inject arbitrary content into the Headers of the requests .

Upon increasing the size of the payload in the header , it leads to 500 Internal Sever Error , which means that this is a kind of Denial Of Service due to Arbitrary Content being Injected into the headers further leading to the Server side issue.

The Crafted Vulnerable request is :

The response consist of the injected Text for certain limit and there after the Server responds with 500 Internal Server error.

So , this I believe turns out to be a DoS by Injecting arbitrary content in headers.
