Summary:

I would like to report a prototype pollution attack in cached-path-relative.
It allows an attacker to inject properties on Object.prototype which are then inherited by all the JS objects through the prototype chain.

# Module

**module name:** cached-path-relative
**version:** 1.0.1
**npm page:** `https://www.npmjs.com/package/cached-path-relative`

## Module Description

Memoize the results of the path.relative function. path.relative can be an expensive operation if it happens a lot, and its results shouldn't change for the same arguments.

## Module Stats

352,446 downloads in the last week

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

If the attacker can control both the path and the cached value, she can deploy a prototype pollution attack and thus overwrite arbitrary properties on Object.prototype.

## Steps To Reproduce:

```js
var relative = require('cached-path-relative');
relative('__proto__', 'x');
console.log({}.x);
```

## Patch

Initialize the cache using Object.create(null) or use the Map data structure.

# Wrap up

- I contacted the maintainer to let them know: N
- I opened an issue in the related repository: N

## Impact

I am not sure how clients of this module use the API, but if attacker can control both the values passed to cached-path-relative, the attacker can write arbitrary properties on Object.prototype.
