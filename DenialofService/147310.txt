Summary:
Summary: If ntpd is configured to allow mrulist query requests from a server that sends a crafted malicious packet, ntpd will crash on receipt of that crafted malicious mrulist query packet.

Mitigation:
  - Only allow `mrulist` query packets from trusted hosts.
  - Implement BCP-38.
  - Upgrade to 4.2.8p9, or later, from the [NTP Project Download Page](http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html) or the [NTP Public Services Project Download Page](http://support.ntp.org/download)
  - Properly monitor your `ntpd` instances, and auto-restart `ntpd` (without `-g`) if it stops running.
