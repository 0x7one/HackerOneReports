Summary:

Hello Team ,

####Description : 
This report is similar to #106350 , as we can see in report an user or attacker is __able to inject his text__ into error page and can trap to user to visit other site by adding following link  `/test/%2f../It%20has%20been%20changed%20by%20a%20new%20one%20https://www.Attacker.com%20so%20go%20to%20the%20new%20one%20since%20this%20one` after the Domain name , and it got fixed after that report with static 404 error page , 

but i got place where __old fix is not getting apply__ , so i hope u will like to fix this too .
