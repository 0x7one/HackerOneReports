Summary:

Hi.

I'm going to talk about brute-force for finding emails in the sign-up page.

Reproduction Steps 


1-Send a request like this

POST https://get.uber.com/signup_submit/ HTTP/1.1

email=efkan162%40gmail.com&password=11111111xxxx&first_name=Trial&last_name=Trial&mobile_country=TR&mobile=533+633+4000&language=tr_TR&card_number=%

NOTE:The request body goes like this I deleted de other parts because it's too long but I have to say other parts like card_number or card_bin have to be valid for brute-force.

2-When you did this request response header will be like this "HTTP/1.1 406 NOT ACCEPTABLE" and this is the text view of the response.

{"username":"Kullan\u0131c\u0131 ad\u0131 zaten kaydedilmi\u015f","reason":"username_already_registered","email":"Bu e-posta daha \u00f6nce kaydedilmi\u015f. Mevcut hesab\u0131n\u0131zda oturum a\u00e7\u0131n veya farkl\u0131 bir e-posta ile kay\u0131t olun."}


3-efkan162@gmail.com THİS EMAİL İS REGİSTERED FOR MY ANOTHER ACCOUNT.This is why response says"username_already_registered" so we can understand an account with efkan162@gmail.com registered to uber.

4-When you send a request with a not-using email  you'll see the respone header "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" that means this e-mail can usable and nobody has an registered account with this e-mail.

5-We can brute force with post method because there is no errors or request time protection like "Too Many Requests".


Finally,an attacker or a  hacker could find the registered e-mails to Uber service with brute-force method.Like using mail lists word lists or creating random mails with some words and some number.

How To Fix:

You need to add request time protection to there "POST https://get.uber.com/signup_submit/"


About the attachments:

I sent more than 100 requests in 3 seconds as you can see in the requests.png.There was no error.
And I used an non-registered mail to Uber in the 200.png
In 406.png  I used my other account's email and it said "406 Not Acceptable"

I hope you'll fix it as soon as possible you can for security of your members
