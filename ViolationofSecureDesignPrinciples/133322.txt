Summary:
@siddiki reported to us that under certain conditions it is possible to make select actions on a report happen but not appear in the report timeline. We reviewed the potential security consequences as a result of this behavior and came to the conclusion this is a low priority functionality bug with no unacceptable security risks. 
Null bytes are not permitted in report body, or even in report title. But that can be used in the comment section of `self-closing` (for reporter) and `change-status` (for team). When a null byte is used as a comment, that report timeline activity disappears!

For example: 
https://hackerone.com/reports/133317 report was closed using a null byte in comment.

{F88258}

There is no activity log in the report details for the closing, but the report is closed.
