Summary:

Hi, team
I noticed that while registering qiwi account with Indian mobile number, the verfication code is not coming.
I think somewhere there is an error in your system.
Vulnerable url :
qiwi.com

After entering  Indian mobile .
https://qiwi.com/register/password.action?identifier=50845626&login=%2B917569323695#

Your system is not sending verification code .
As a result registration process is not getting completed.
Thanks and regards
Haji
