My writeup is available (unpublished) at:

https://p4fg.github.io/h1_415_2020/

I might edit some styling but the main contents is there. 

The twist of my writeup is that tried to give a detailed account of EVERYTHING to allow new hackers to follow along my discoveries and failures, thoughts and despair, just as if they were sitting beside me. 

Solving a CTF on this level is not as easy as some writeups make it sound, and i hope my writeup will show not only how it was solved, but the mindset and ideas behind a lot of failed attempts. You learn a lot from the failures as well!

Thanks for a nice CTF!
