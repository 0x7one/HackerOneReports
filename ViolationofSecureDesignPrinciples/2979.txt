Summary:

Here is an unvalidated insertion of an image, resulting to content spoofing

https://awayon.slack.com/account/photo?url=http://www.thenewstribe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Syrian-Electronic-Army-hacked-CNN.jpg

It displays any photo, what the attacker must know is just the "awayon" or the team name.

Thank you.
