### Summary
The salesforce login integration allows attacker to bypass email verification -- user is able to signup with any email domain they want, effectively bypass all email domain whitelist/blacklist restriction or any other 3rd party using gitlab instance's email address.

It is possible because salesforce allow admin to create user with arbitrary email, and I believe this is what gitlab engineer forgot to consider while implementing salesforce integration.

Please follow along to see how I was able to create an account `ronworkingitlab@gitlab.com` in gitlab.com

### Steps to reproduce
- Visit https://bugcrowd-ngalog-3.oktapreview.com/
- Enter creds `ronworkingitlab@gitlab.com`:`P@ssw0rd!`
- Click salesforce to login salesforce
- Open new tab and visit https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in
- Click login with salesforce
- you will be logged in as `ronworkingitlab@gitlab.com` by visiting `https://gitlab.com/profile/emails`



### Impact
Bypass email domain restriction and able to signup with arbitrary email domain

### What is the current *bug* behavior?
Able to signup with any email domain

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?
should need email verification
