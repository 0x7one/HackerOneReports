WeaknessName:Violation of Secure Design Principles
Reporter:https://hackerone.com/jack898

Severity:
State:Closed
DateOfDisclosure:16.01.2018 14:52:07

Summary:

NOTE BEFOREHAND: I KNOW it's not located on the core showmax.com domain, but that doesn't effect the applications of this and it still has the same risk.

**Summary:** At https://sso.showmax.com/auth/failure?message=, you can change the message parameter to any text and it will be returned on the page in a red box. This could lead to phishing and confusing users since the text is being returned within the actual website.

**Description:** You can take the URL https://sso.showmax.com/auth/failure?message= and change the "message" parameter to any text (and you can encode it with percent encoding) and it will be returned as text on the loaded page.

**Platform(s) Affected:** Tested in Chrome 63.0.3239.132 (Official Build) (64-bit), should work in most situations

**User Identification:**████████ but N/A


## Steps To Reproduce:

1. Take the URL https://sso.showmax.com/auth/failure?message=
2. Change the message parameter text to anything
3. Copy and paste the new URL into a browser
4. You'll notice the text is returned clearly in a red box at the top of the loaded page

## Supporting Material/References:

  I attached an image with an example payload.

## Impact

An attacker could use this to phish and steal user accounts by setting it up with a convincing, percent-encoded message to redirect them to a site with a fake login that steals their information.
Example of an attacker payload: https://sso.showmax.com/auth/failure?message=%47%6F%20%74%6F%20%65%76%69%6C%2E%63%6F%6D

As you can see, at first glance this URL doesn't give away the text in the box, making it even more convincing and dangerous. A real attacker could obviously make a more convincing payload though that said something like my attached image.
