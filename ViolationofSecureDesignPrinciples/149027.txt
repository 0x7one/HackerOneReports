Summary:

Dear Team,
There is password change issue with bridge.cspr.ng

Issue:
-------------
User is not receiving notification when he/she reset password via password reset link.
when user change his info like password change. User doesn't get email notification for password change etc.
It will be a good practice to always send email notification for user for any user related info update.

Please let me know if more details required.

I hope you will fix it soon!
