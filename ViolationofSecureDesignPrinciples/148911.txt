Summary:

Hey, I've found a 'minor' issue in bridge.cspr.ng [CMS Airship]

The issue is 'username enumeration' 

Means, an attacker can know that if a user exists or not; just by noticing the error! So, once the attacker knows that a user exists, he can launch a *brute force* attack against it!

### Steps of replication
1. Go to password reset page
2. Enter an username which exists, there would be no error, and it will be redirected to login page
3. Enter an username which doesn't exists, there would be an error saying something like 'user account doesn't exists etc..'

### Mediation
- Error should be same in both conditions like, every time it should redirect to login page; or you can also fix by adding this: "If email/username exists in our DB, an email for your password reset will be sent!" etc..

Hope you'll fix this soon! 

Thanks
