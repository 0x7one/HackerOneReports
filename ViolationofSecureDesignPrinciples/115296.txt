Hello,

You Have All Cacheable SSL Pages in Domain .

It is possible to gather sensitive information about the web application such as usernames, passwords, Contact information , comments or any machine name and/or sensitive file locations.

Sensitive information might have been cached by your browser

Most web browsers are configured by default to cache the user's pages during use. This means that SSL pages are cached as well. 

It is not recommended to enable the web browser to save any SSL information, since this information might be compromised when a vulnerability exists.
