Summary:

Good Day,
Instacart

In list and recipe we could see that we can upload a picture . It won't accept `.svg` files but by changing it to `.png`.
###Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a list and recipe under accounts
2. Upload a picture. We will upload an `svg` but with a `png` extension. I've attached an `svg` file please open it and save it as `file.png`
3. Now upload the photo and you will then now see that the svg we have made is reflected in the background photo area.

Regards,
TOM
