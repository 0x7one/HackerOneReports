Summary:

Hey team,

I've found a snapchat cdn domain here which had a test instance of fastly setup but did not remove the dns record when the service was cancelled. This allowed me to create a Fastly instance to take it over. I've confirmed this is a snapchat property via Censys (https://censys.io/certificates/65ba2e172a1eb85eb1071c9fd7a4e8371ef12625409890507c89a54978305558) though the risk here seems minimal at best as this domain does not appear to be used anywhere on any snapchat properties.

Repro steps:

* Visit http://fastly.sc-cdn.net/takeover.html

Recommended fix:
Removal of this record is recommended.
