Summary:
CSP script-src unsafe directive needed for Google Tag Manager
Hi Dear Maximum Team

Hope you are good!

**Vulnerablity Summary**
The HTTP header of the werkenbijmcdonalds.nl website includes an unsafe-inline parameter for "script-src".

**Impact:**
However, the "script-src" parameter is set to "unsafe-inline" or "unsafe-eval", which allows injection of user passed values, which in result can be misused for Cross-Site Scripting attacks.This is to allow "bootstrapping" or passing data to JavaScript from HTML pages. It's a dangerous setting, so I recommend here to fix it soon by passing data to JavaScript in the DOM instead of creating JavaScript variables from HTML.


**Mitigation**
Please remove "unsafe-inline" from "script-src", to  resolve. Thanks for reading this!

If you need help, be free to ask.

Happy to help.

Regards,
@smit
