Summary:

It is possible to spam any user whose email-id is known.

This can be combined with csrf attack i.e automated to send 50 emails with a click.

This is reset password form --->

<form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="https://hackerone.com/users/password" class="new_user" id="new_user" method="post"><div style=""><input name="utf8" value="âœ“" type="hidden"><input name="authenticity_token" value="AjjZNIMzdX598CXInx9CMbovtHbiqL+ziw4qTJ7RFnZQh/oub+mYFKjjNb1TXyITVCpkFPJ21ViG4IQz72KbMQ==" type="hidden"></div>

  <h1 class="narrow-title">Forgot password</h1>

  <div class="narrow-container">
    <p>To retrieve your password enter the email address you used to sign up.</p>

    <div class="input-wrapper-small">
      <input autofocus="autofocus" class="input" id="user_email" name="user[email]" placeholder="Email address" type="email">
    </div>

    <input class="button success is-full-width" data-disable-with="Sending..." name="commit" value="Send" type="submit">
  </div>
</form>

Here,
<input name="authenticity_token" value="AjjZNIMzdX598CXInx9CMbovtHbiqL+ziw4qTJ7RFnZQh/oub+mYFKjjNb1TXyITVCpkFPJ21ViG4IQz72KbMQ==" type="hidden">

authencity token can be used more than one.
Users can be spammed heavily by just simple coding a script.
Only email-id should be known.

I tried it on my own account. I was able to use the token for more than 5 attempts.
This is not best practice.
Only one try must be allowed.
