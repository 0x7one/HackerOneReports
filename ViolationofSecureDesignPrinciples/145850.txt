Summary:

Issue:
======
Hey, I've found content spoofing also known as "Text Injection" in your sub-domain docs.nextcloud.org

URL:
-------
Here is the malicious URL:
https://docs.nextcloud.org/.htacessCONTENT%20SPOOFING%20BY%20AHSAN

Fix:
Use custom 403 error page which doesn't contain user's text!

I hope you'll fix it soon!

Thanks,
