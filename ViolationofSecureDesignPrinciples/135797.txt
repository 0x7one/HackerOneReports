Summary
-------------

Your login flow is vulnerable to session fixation. This can allow an attacker to steal a valid user session from a victim.

Steps to reproduce
--------------

1. As the attacker go to https://wallet.sandbox.romit.io (but do not login!) and check the cookies `romit.sandbox.session` and `SANDBOX-XSRF-TOKEN`, that are set. For example:

    ```
SANDBOX-XSRF-TOKEN=AAG02cId-yyza3k8uhQR7JKuB-4YOmhizkjM; 
romit.sandbox.session=s%3AEHm0kA9uwWYHayOwdRQXbuZWEIRIliQZ.ndejz36ofa52c9ENnApLuaLkMnTYCot3IiY1qdTvz0w;
```
2. Now simulate the victim by opening a second browser and setting those two cookies.
3. As the victim, login in the second browser.
4. As the attacker, go to https://wallet.sandbox.romit.io (using the first browser / same cookies as in step 1). You are now logged in to the victims account.

Possible exploitation scenarios
---------------

This can be exploited if there is another bug like HTTP Response Splitting on your website. 

But a far easier way is to exploit this on shared computers. For example in a library, as an attacker open https://wallet.sandbox.romit.io (but do not login!) and keep note of the cookies as above in step 1. Then simply go away and now when a victim will use the same computer and try to login, the attacker will have access to the victims account.

Mitigation
--------------

If you assign a new session when someone logs in, this flaw should be fixed.
