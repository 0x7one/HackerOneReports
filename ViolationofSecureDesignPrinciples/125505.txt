Summary:

When adding new promotion codes for free rides, one could brute force invitation codes since there is no protection against brute force attacks. 

When going to payment page, it's possible to apply promotion code. If we intercept this request, we can brute force codes, since there is no captcha or limit for tries.

In the pictures bellow, we can see the brute force in question with 3 types of different responses that allow us, to see if the code is valid, expired or invalid.

Responses length:
* 1951 - Valid code
* 1931 - Not valid
* 1921 - Code Expired

Because there is a option to customize codes, and since all the codes that are customized begin with uber, we were able drop the time of the brute force, to a more practical attack.

Finally, we could use a code to get a free ride. An attacker could use this vulnerability to ride in uber for free, creating multiple accounts, each one using one code.
