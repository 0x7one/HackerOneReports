Summary:

Hi,

With this bug, a local attacker can infect users with malware. it
works this way, after the sign up page or most pages, a Download
prompt appears. (for example, at your Hackerone Page hackerone.com/owncloud),
However, the downloads url, in my case, it was 

http://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-daily-stable8.1.tar.bz2

Did you see what I see? the page is delievered by http. so an attacker
does this, downloads the file, bind a malware to it. host it to his
server, and when a legit user try to donwload it, deliever the payload
binded with the games. user runs that, game over. who's to blame?
well, duh... owncloud!

The easiest solution is just changing the URL from
http://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-daily-stable8.1.tar.bz2
to https://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-daily-stable8.1.tar.bz2
because the site works both ways, only... the second one gets
downloaded from an encrypted source. I don't even know why you put the
HTTP version anyways.

Note: I am doing this for the points, not the bounty. so please don't damage it.

Thanks again,
Paulos
