Summary:

Hi,

when I was submitted a report to a program that request `2FA` ON, I notice that if you try to disable this option will ask for `backup code - password` and if you enter a random password in the request filed and a correct `backup code` it will be successfully disabled the `2FA` without check if the password was correct or not.

#PoC
1. go to your account and activate the `2FA` from `/settings/auth`
2. after active this option click on `Disabled` icon beside `Two-factor authentication`.
3. a new window will open asking for `Authentication or backup code - Password` to confirm the disabled.
{F494646}
4. in the first box enter a valid `Authentication or backup code` and in the password filed enter any random/wrong password and click save.
5. the option will be disabled successful without check the validation of the password.

## Impact

user can disable `Two-factor authentication` without entering a valid password
