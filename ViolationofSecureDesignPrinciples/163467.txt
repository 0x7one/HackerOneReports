Summary:

When a user is logged on, the following is sent:

```
██████
```

This contains some sensitive information, most notably the email token. A user can use this to bypass email verification and verify any email.

In addition, the hashed password is leaked, which could present a vulnerability if a user's account is compromised without compromising the password.
