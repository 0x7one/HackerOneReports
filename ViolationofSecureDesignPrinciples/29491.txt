Summary:

the IDN: http://ebаy.com/

is a homograph for the latin ebay.com. if you click that first link, youm might think that you are going to ebay.com. in fact, you are going to a homograph url http://xn--eby-7cd.com/

more info http://www.charset.org/punycode.php?encoded=http%3A%2F%2Fxn--eby-7cd.com%2F&decode=Punycode+to+normal+text

it would be safer to show the punycode version of the url so that it would be apparent that something weird is going on. that is, show http://xn--eby-7cd.com/ instead of http://ebаy.com/
