Summary:

If I change my username to "**test**" then as in normal case it will send a GET request to **/test/settings** but if I change my username to "**..**" (**double dot** within inverted commas)  then it will send GET request to /settings because /../settings will change to /settings and hence final GET request will be to /settings which will show a 404 page.
 I have attached a video as POC.
