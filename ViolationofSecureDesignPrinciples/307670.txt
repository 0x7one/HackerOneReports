Summary:

Hello!

When using the Keybase Chrome extension and viewing a Hacker News profile page with an additional `id` parameter in the query string, Hacker News uses the username from the first `id` parameter, whereas the Keybase extension uses the username from the second `id` parameter.

Example URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=TomNomNom&id=edoverflow

{F256097}

Note that this is the profile page for the Hacker News user `TomNomNom`, whereas the Keybase Chat modal is for the (in this case non-existent) Keybase user `TornNomNom` (i.e. with the first `m` replaced with an `r` and an `n`). In a real attack the attacker would register the Keybase account, use the same Avatar as the target, and probably choose a more convincing homograph than `m` -> `rn`

## Impact

Users attempting to send a secure, sensitive message to a Keybase user can be tricked into sending that message to a malicious user instead.
