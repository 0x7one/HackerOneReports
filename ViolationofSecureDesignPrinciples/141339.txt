Summary:

The Issue is with the design of sending SMS by the uber referrals system, and every day it's flodding my phone number with driver invitaion message 

To reproduce this scenario i have  Fuzz the below request Through OWSAP Zap I fuzzed for 10,000 requests , keep the same Phone number (I have used my number), After 20 tries uber will send message the Limit is over ,  you will recieve 60 SMS since the meessage size is more it will come in three part , 

Now the real proble will start from next and consecutive days, Every day i'm recieving 60 SMS starting at 9:30 AM IST
