Summary:

Hi there ,I have found a very critical systematic issue that enable a user  to create any number of account with one email .
It can be resolved by sending a conformation link  to the email of the registerer.
IF one user has 1 Gigabytes storage he can make any number of gigabytes as he need and this will affect your system badly .
#POC:

Waiting for your generous bounty .
