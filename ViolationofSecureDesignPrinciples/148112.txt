Summary:

Hi,

I want to talk about your ESSB plugin.When I was doing a research about it I saw that link

"  http://blog.trello.com/wp-content/plugins/easy-social-share-buttons3/public/essb-mail.php  "

When you navigate that link it says {"message":"Error sending message!"}

But when you put the right parameters to link like this >>

http://blog.trello.com/wp-content/plugins/easy-social-share-buttons3/public/essb-mail.php?from=&to=&sub=&message=

An attacker can send emails to anybody with using your mail accounts.Let's see

I'm going to use a mail from fake mail system >>>   Eall1935@rhyta.com 
This is trello's support mail address >>> support@trello.com

For subject I would use "Password Change" ,that would be a good example for social engineering 
For message let's say : Your password is too old.Please send your current password to xxx@mail.com

Finally this is our link : 

http://blog.trello.com/wp-content/plugins/easy-social-share-buttons3/public/essb-mail.php?from=support@trello.com&to=Eall1935@rhyta.com&sub=Password%20Change&message=Your%20password%20is%20too%20old.Please%20send%20your%20current%20password%20to%20xxx@mail.com

When I click that link it will send me that mail from support@trello.com.For proof I am going to add some screenshots please check them out.

So,an attacker can use it for taking member's password,private informations,anything... with using ESSB plugin's mail system and social engineering.

How To Fix:

I think you should update your ESSB plugin.
