Summary:

Hi Team,

### Details:
I have found that the csrf_token ( fkey parameter )which prevent CSRF attacks is fixed in same browser and didn't changed even user login or logout , a lot of users can use the same CSRF_token , this can be exploited such 2 ways :
 
### Shared computers:
- attacker open "https://www.khanacademy.org" and login to his account
- attacker copied the value of "fkey parameter" then he will logout
- victim will logged in his account with the same CSRF_token value (fkey parameter)
- now attacker forced the victim to change his email address to attacker emails , since he already have the valid CSRF_token

### XSS:
- due to XSS vulnerability. Attacker knows the CSRF_token for the victim so he can use this in any actions behind the victim , for example :  change user email address   

CSRF PoC to takeover user account by linked the attacker email address:

```
<html>
  <body>
    <form action="https://www.khanacademy.org/settings/linkemail" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="fkey" value="CSRF_token" />
      <input type="hidden" name="email" value="[attacker-email-address]" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Impact

As i described above this can be exploited to takeover another account

Let me know if there is anything unclear
