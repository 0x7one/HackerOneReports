Summary:

Hi,
Zawad here.

**Description**
I recently visited gratipay.com and logged in.
I found that invalid characters ( *eg. null bytes* ) were accepted in email field, which is obviously not an expected behavior.

**Steps to Reproduce**
1. Go to https://gratipay.com/~username/emails/
2. Enter `yourname@domain.com\0` or `you@abc.com%00` or `you@xyz.com$`
3. Now ***Inspect Element*** the field and change field type to **`text`** from **`email`**
4. Click on **Add email address**.
You'll see an error message ***Looks like you've found a bug! Sorry for the inconvenience, we'll get it fixed ASAP!***
Now reload the page and you'll see the email listed.

It means server side validation of email is not okay.
Validation should be improved.

For your reference, #3227 and #3991 are same kind of bug which were resolved.
