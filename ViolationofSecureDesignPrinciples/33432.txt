Hey Team
this is geekboy :)

this report is about broken authentication in mobile section .

Description : 
when user want to add any mobile number to his account , he will go mobile section and twitter will ask the user to select the country and enter the mobile number .

so when testing i entered the random mobile number and twitter says that verification code sent to the mobile number , and asking for the verification code >> http://sd.uploads.im/NsmJl.png

i cant provide the code coz i entered the random number .

now i logged out my account and came to forget password page .

the issue is here , twitter asking me to send the verification code on the mobile number which i didn't verified and  its not associated with my account .  >> http://sd.uploads.im/LRUhA.png

so without verification Twitter should not associate the mobile number with account for the password reset purpose ! 

Thanks
geekboy :)
