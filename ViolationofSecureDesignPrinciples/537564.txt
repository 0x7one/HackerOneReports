__summary__

Hi OLX team, i found a web cache deception vulnerability in https://tradus.com.
With this vulnerability an attacker can gain access to the name of the victim user, the user_id and other  informations.

__Attack scenario__

1) an attacker send to the victim a link to the malicious page (like the PoC that i've attached)
2) the victim click on the link, the link request a special page on tradus.com
3) now the victim name, user_id and the other info in the page are in the cache server
4) the attacker reach the page as unauthenticated user

I've attached some pics of the data that can be stolen and a PoC.
for the proof of concept you got to enable the pop-up in your browser.

__step to reproduce (first way)__
1) once you are authenticated open the PoC
2) now you can see the cached URL, follow the URL in a private browser window (like unauthenticated user).
3) the HTML with the info will be returned by the cache server

__step to reproduce (second way)__
1) once you are authenticated follow this: https://www.tradus.com/en/search/q/%22&.js?sort=price-asc&query=%26%2334%3B%26
2) follow the same URL in a private browser window (like unauthenticated user).
3) the HTML with the info will be returned by the cache server

NOTE: the .js extension before the query string made this possible. it's possible that it work with other extension and in other path or domain in scope i will test once you have triage that(if this will be triaged).

I know that information disclosure are out of scope, so please if you reputed this n/a please don't do it, i can self close this as n/a without lost reputation points.

thanks
