It is not possible to edit your rating but there is a way to bypass that restriction 


Steps:

1- login to your uber account https://riders.uber.com

2- View your trips https://riders.uber.com/trips

3- choose one of your trips 

4- click on resend 

5- check your email

6- you will find a button in email to rate your driver

7- rate it to 4 or 3 (something different than the original rating)

8- you will get a message indicating that you successfully changed it

9- go back to https://riders.uber.com/trips

10- your find that rating changed or may be not changed 

11- you will need to click on filter trips and choose filter by credit card or city
