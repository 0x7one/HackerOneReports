Summary:
The suggestion was to set `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: master-only`. From [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/AppSec/xdomain.html) ([per](https://github.com/twitter/secureheaders/issues/88)):

> Normally a meta-policy is declared in the master policy file, but for those who canâ€™t write to the root directory, they can also declare a meta-policy using the X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies HTTP response header.

However, our web site and web applications do not use Adobe Flash. As far as we can tell, this header is concerned only with the security of Flash content.
