Summary:

***Issue***
New HackerOne exciting addition is the ability to include inline images by using their reference_ID, which is in this case {Fxxxxx}. The reference ID is bind to the its report Context_ID and cant be referenced by others (unique reference

Is seems that if the reference_ID is used in another newest report the attachment is deleted from the original report

Note: Reports must belong to the same reporter

POC
1. Create a Report with an attachment and file it to any team. Notice the reference_ID (Fxxxxx)
2. Create a new Report for any team and reference the ID via a POST in draft_Sync
 `POST /security/reports/draft_sync HTTP/1.1`
As soon as you do the POST Go to `the https://hackeone/security/reports/new`
You will see the reference_ID attachment attached.
3. Go to the report in 1. The reference_ID and attachment is deleted for the original report!
