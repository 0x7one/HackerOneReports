Summary:
The location bar in the files app was not verifying the passed parameters. An attacker could craft an invalid link to a fake directory structure and use this to display an attacker-controlled error message to the user.

------
Thanks a lot, @ishahriyar   for pointing out this vulnerability!
In Nextcloud the "dir" parameter is vulnerable to content spoofing attack.
If anyone puts a valid directory name in dir parameter then it goes that directory other wise it redirects
to the home directory (/)
By putting `../../` in dir parameter I was able to stop the redirect then I had put some messages after that and that messages reflected with the same given format.

So here an  attacker can send his messages directly through url.
