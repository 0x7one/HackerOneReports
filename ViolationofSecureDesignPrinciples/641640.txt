##Summary

Attacker can embed `RTLO` character at the following URL https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/link_redirector?url= to trick the user to download suspicious files.

##Steps to reproduce
 
* Visit https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/link_redirector?url=
* add the following payload to the url parameter `https://example.com/so%E2%80%AEgnp.exe`
[https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/link_redirector?url=https://example.com/so%E2%80%AEgnp.exe](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/link_redirector?url=https://example.com/so%E2%80%AEgnp.exe)
* After visiting the URL you will see the following link appearing on the page, which appears to be a link to a png file.
{F527747}
* Click on the link and you will be redirected to an executable file.
{F527750}

##Additional Payloads

Attacker can even spoof the domain name by adding the following value to the `url` parameter 
`https://google.com@%E2%80%AE@moc.rettiwt`
{F527754}
When the user will click on the link the user will be redirected to `https://moc.rettiwt/` which is a completely different host.

I have also tested some other malformed URLs which can fool user to redirect to other hosts
```
https://google.com@"twitter.com
https://google.com@'twitter.com
https://google.com@/twitter.com
https://google.com@'#twitter.com (Different domain)
```

##Mitigation

Filter out all the unnecessary special symbols from the URL along with the RTLO char.
