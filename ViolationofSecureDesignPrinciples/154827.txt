Summary:

Hi! It's still possible to use an invalid `dir` param to spoof messages in the directory breadcrumbs area.

For example, you can use URL-encoded periods to bypass the directory traversal prevention. By referencing a path that returns a 301, you can add a message in the dir param F108266:

https://demo.nextcloud.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2E%2E/%2E%2E/%2E%2E/.well-known/caldav/Error%20-%20please%20restart%20your%20computer%20to%20continue

Also, in Chrome, the presence of a null byte (%00) in the url causes a CSP error for an ajax request upon pageload, which prevents the redirect to `dir=/` and allows you to put a message in the dir param F108267:

https://demo.nextcloud.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%00Error!%20Please%20restart%20your%20computer%20and%20try%20again

Please let me know if you need more info. Thanks!
