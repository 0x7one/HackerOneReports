Summary:
When testing csrf tokens on WakaTime's website, there are 2 ways we pass the csrf token in requests:

1. form post-data `csrftoken`, for HTML form submits
2. the `X-CSRFToken` header, for AJAX requests

The `csrftoken` cookie is only used to pass the token to JavaScript, it's not used for validating the request.

Closing this as not applicable since csrf tokens are working correctly.
step of reproduce-
1. Go to https://wakatime.com and create account.
2. login account after that go public profile.
3. after that change the full name and intercept brup suite and delete csrftoken.
4. After forward then you see name was changed.
