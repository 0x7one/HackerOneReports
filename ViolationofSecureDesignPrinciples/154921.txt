Summary:
Researcher @ahsantahir reported a content spoofing on the search functionality. The search query was displayed in the page, but without any prefix. We added "Results for:", so nobody can be misinformed.

This has been [fixed in the last version](https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/commit/382483c727a6eca08ad9880c2583437139f01df3) and the fix is now deployed.

Thanks for making Gratipay a safer place!
