Summary:

hi,

At url `https://www.uber.com/unsubscribe` you can unsubscribe any email of any user, which is bit of concern for the people who wants to receive emails from uber.

only people who gets email from uber should be allowed to unsubscribe themselves from uber emails rather than anybody unsubscribing anyone

Regards
Ashish
