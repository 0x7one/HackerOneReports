Summary:

Hi there,

**URL:** https://www.sfl-tap.army.mil/
I have seen that the website is using the X-XSS-Protection Header.

But it has a strange configuration.
When I take a look at securityheaders, I've seen that you guys use this as configuration.

**X-XSS-Protection:** DENY

DENY is used for the X-Frame Option instead of the X-XSS-Protection. The good configuration should be:

**XSS-XSS-Protection:** 1; mode=block

And not DENY. This is used for the X-Frame Option.
