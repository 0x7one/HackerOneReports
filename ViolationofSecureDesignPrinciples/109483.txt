Summary:
Team members that only had read-only permissions were able to both request and approve public disclosure. This would also allow read-only team members to post a public comment.

This bug depends on a trusted team member with read-only permissions. Because of that, the consequences are not severe.
Hi,

I found out that a user who belongs to a group with Read-Only permission can still request and approuve public disclosure when the report is closed by privileged admin although that these permissions are only allowed if the user group has **Report** scope.

Consequently, the team member with limited scope can also post public comment through public dislosure request and that contradicts what was expected.

**Proof Of Concept :**
1. Create a new user group with Read-Only permission
2. Add a user to the group.
3. Log in with that user account and browse a Closed report, you should now be able to request public disclosure.

Kind regards.
