Summary:

Hi there,

I noticed two things on the following url: https://www.cloudflare.com/ajax/modal-dialog.html

##1. CSRF
There are some csrf countermeasures in place (e.g. X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest), however they're not validated on the server. 

This leads to an uncritical csrf:

```
<html>
  <body>
    <form action="https://www.cloudflare.com/ajax/modal-dialog.html" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="type" value="default" />
      <input type="hidden" name="content" value="This&#32;is&#32;my&#32;content" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

##2. Content spoofing
Using 1.) I can send some abitary content within the ```content``` parameter to my victim. 

The ```Content-Type``` is ```text/html```, however I was not able to break the filter and conduct a xss at the first glance.

As said, I could send an abitary message fomatted with new-lines to my victim telling him to send over some details or something (be creative here :) ). That would result in a (lame) phishing attack.

#What should you fix?
 - Set a better Content-Type. E.g. "text/plain" 
- Validate the CSRF headers
- Do not send the displayed error message in the request. (e.g. hardcode those message and pass an ID depending on the situation).

Let me know, what you think about this.

Thanks,
Sebastian
