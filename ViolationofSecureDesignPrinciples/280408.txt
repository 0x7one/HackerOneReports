Summary:

I am just looking at your SPF records then found following. SPF Records missing safe check which can allow me to send mail on behalf of infogram.

#PoC:
The TXT records found for your domain are:
```
"v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:spf.mandrillapp.com include:mailgun.org ~all"
```
Simply anyone can use ```https://emkei.cz/``` service to trigger mail to anyone on behalf of infogram.
#Fix:

```v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:spf.mandrillapp.com include:mailgun.org -all```

>#*If team don't wanna hear about spf related checks please let me know. i'll close this report myself.*
