Summary:

**Issue**
In case of Operator Wallets, only `Owner` has the permission to delete share with any user. But It is possible for any user to delete share for any other user.

**POC**
1. Suppose a wallet `BITCOINS` is created by user A and shared with user B and C.
2. User B can send the following request and delete User C as there are no server side verifications

    POST /dashboard/account/<accountID>/sharing/delete HTTP/1.1
    Host: wallet.romit.io
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:37.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/37.0

    bankUserId=<User C's ID>&_csrf=3b919c4a-776f-4144-84b7-88d315f57815

**Solution**
Verify that the user who is deleting the user is actually an owner for that wallet.
