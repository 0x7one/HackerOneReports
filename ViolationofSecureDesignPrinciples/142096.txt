Summary:

Hi,

I found out some neglected DNS records that can be exploited to takedown the subdomain of Slack's acquisition `feedback.screenhero.com`

The security issue is that you have CNAME record that points `feedback.screenhero.com` to a `screenhero.uservoice.com`, but the problem is that the service is inactive, thus any malicious hacker would simply sign up for the service and claims the username `Screenhero` as his and no verification is done by the Service Provider, besides that the DNS-setup is already correctly set.

**Scenario attack :**
Attacker can now build a complete clone of the real site, add a login form, redirect the user, steal credentials (e.g. admin accounts), cookies and/or completely destroy business credibility for your company along with along with injecting malicious codes to steal their sensitive cookies, redirect them to malicious web pages etc.

**Mitigation :** To mitigate the threat you should remove CNAME DNS records for the services you don't use anymore.
