Summary:

Hello,

There exists a race condition in redeeming coupons, allowing a user to redeem the same coupon multiple times, and stacking savings added. This allows for a user to get virtually any discount.

POC:

1. Visit your account and select 'Promo Codes'.
2. Select redeem promo code, and add any promo code. For example, I found the code 'dallas20'.
3. Intercept the request using a proxy, and make the request multiple times, asynchronously.
4. The code will be redeemed multiple times.

For an example, see the screenshot attached.
