Summary:

Hello Hackerone,

**Summary:**
I have found that #38343 is not yet fully fixed, disabled user is not always gets notification about password change when a password is changed via password reset link, then such a notification is not send to the disabled user.

**Description (Include Impact):**
When a password changed in user's profile `When a password changed in user's profile` or `password reset links` for `enabled/active user` receives a notification via email containing that the password was recently changed. This is the fixed that reported in #38343. 

However, it defeats the fix in #38343 because when a password changed in `password reset links` for `disabled/inactive user` does not receive notification via email containing that password was recently changed.
