## Summary:

The executable installer BraveSetup-ia32.exe is vulnerable to DLL hijacking: it loads (at least) version.dll from its application directory (which is typically the user's "Downloads" directory %USERPROFILE%\Downloads) instead Windows' system directory %SystemRoot%\System32

## Products affected: 

Windows 7 and newer versions, Brave version 0.18.36

## Steps To Reproduce:

Place the attached version.dll in %USERPROFILE%\Downloads, download the current BraveSetup-ia32.exe and execute it: version.dll displays message boxes showing its caller.
