Summary:

Hi,

The X-FRAME-OPTIONS header returned from https://www.periscope.tv is:
```
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM https://twitter.com/
```
But Chrome doesn't support this value for the header: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking_Defense_Cheat_Sheet.
Because of that, no value for X-FRAME-OPTIONS is set and all of the periscope.tv pages are vulnerable to Clickjacking. You can see for example my attached poc (Make sure you test it on chrome) that I am framing my own user on periscope. I can use regular Clickjacking tricks to make the user follow other users and do practically any action on the site.
