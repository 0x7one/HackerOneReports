Summary:

Hey,
The title of submission defines the issue very clearly which is clickjacking at https://partners.cloudflare.com/ this subdomain missing x frame headers.
As this subdomain contain a partner login then it is dangerous to have this type of issue. You understand better what i mean ;) 
Attached a screenshot kf mobilr showing framing that subdomain in local html file.
I hope you will fix it soon.
Thanks
