Summary:

Hey all,

There seems to be no filtering of strange unicode characters such as U+202E which is an Right-To-Left-Override.
I can send messages like "Hey check out my new song at example.com/song[rtlo]3pm.exe" and everyone would see the link as "example.com/songexe.mp3". 
Links that end with .exe are very suspicious but everyone would click on a link that ends with .mp3, filtering those characters would prevent clickjacking.
I tested this on the latest version of the Android App.

Thanks,
Marvin
