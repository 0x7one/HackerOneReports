Summary:
Users of the commerce widget that have entered their name and email into the widget and moved to the currency selection step were vulnerable to a clickjacking attack that revealed name and email to an attacker due to pre-population of the widget's fields.

After a user filled out the name / email fields and continued on to the currency selection step, these fields were pre-populated when another instance of the commerce widget was opened in other tabs.  Thus, an attacker can set up a malicious website that frames the widget with 0 opacity, and the widget will be prepopulated when a victim that has previously entered name / email in the widget on another page navigates to the attacking page. If the victim clicks on the invisible widget in the attacking page, those pre-populated fields will be used in a new charge sent to whichever merchant the attacking page configured when deploying the widget.

The severity of this issue is low, because the small window of vulnerability (user must be on a specific step during the flow of the commerce widget) and the sensitivity of the information revealed (name and email address).
