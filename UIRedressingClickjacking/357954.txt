Summary:
Reporter filed a report of clickjacking vulnerability without identifying any real exploitation scenario. According to Mail.Ru bug bounty program's rules, clickjacking reports without practical impact are not accepted.

There is seems no practical security impact from this report, because exploitation requires attacker to know which ticket belongs to user and content of the ticket, and even with this information exploitation may require multiple unlikely actions from user. These facts were not validated by reporter, a result of automated scan was reported instead,

In general, page framing/clickjacking should never be reported as a vulnerability. Clickjacking is an exploitation vector rather than vulnerability and ability to frame the page is not vulnerability by itself. Never report clickjacking scan results without identifying clickjacking as an attack vector in any real exploitation scenario with real security impact.

An example of *invalid* clickjacking report is:
"UI redressing due to missed X-Frame-Options"
(clickjacking reported as a vulnerability)

An examples of *valid* clickjacking report are:
"An ability to confirm OAuth trust via clickjacking"
"An ability to remove user's account via clickjacking"
"An ability to modify user's profile data via clickjacking"
(clickjacking reported as an attack vector)
