Summary:

Dear Team,

#POC
Please find attached screenshots

#Steps to reproduce:

create index.html file with following content:
<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms" src="https://app.legalrobot-uat.com/pending-verification" width="1000" height="600"></iframe>

Open index.html in browser

Actual result: Legalrobot email verification page is viewed in iframe.

#Remediation:
Frame busting technique is the better framing protection technique.
Sending the proper X-Frame-Options HTTP response headers that instruct the browser to not allow raming from other domains.

Same issue found in https://app.legalrobot.com/pending-verification as well.
