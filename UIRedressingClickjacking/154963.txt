Summary:

**Hello**

In twitter you can create cards to generate leads.
For example:
https://twitter.com/i/cards/tfw/v1/759046372544741376?cardname=promotion&autoplay_disabled=true&earned=true&lang=en&card_height=357

If you visit the above URL and click the button your email and username is sent to my domain.

Since this page is missing X-FRAME-HEADERS,
a user could simply iframe the URL and could steal victim's emails.

**Proof of concept code**
```
<html>
<iframe src=https://twitter.com/i/cards/tfw/v1/759046372544741376?cardname=promotion&autoplay_disabled=true&earned=true&lang=en&card_height=357>
</html>
```

**Regards,
Akhil**
