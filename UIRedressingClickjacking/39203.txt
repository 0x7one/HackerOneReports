Summary:

Hi
I found a broken authentitication vuln

POC:

1- Create a Wepay account
2- Confirm your email
3- Now request a password reset for your account.
4- Don’t use the password reset link that was sent to your email.
5- Login to your account, remember don’t use first the reset password link you requested in 3 step
6- Change your password in the Account Settings( url: https://www.wepay.com/settings/password)
Step 5. After you changed your password inside your account, Check now the reset password link you requested in Step 3 in your email.
Step 6. Change your password using the reset password link you requested.

If the site has a token issue, The result is the reset password token in the Step 3 is still usable and did not expire yet. Not invalidating the session token for the reset password is not a good practice for a company. 

Fix :
