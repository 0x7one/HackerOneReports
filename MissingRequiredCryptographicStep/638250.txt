Summary:
The reporter noted that our installation instructions for our [Linux Desktop Client for Fedora](https://help.dropbox.com/installs-integrations/desktop/linux-repository) specified HTTP urls instead of HTTPS. This could allow an attacker, with a privileged network position, the ability to swap the GPG key during installation allowing them to install a rogue signing key on the victim's machine.

We updated the instructions in our help center to use HTTPS urls.
