Vulnerability description
This script is possibly vulnerable to CRLF injection attacks. 

HTTP headers have the structure "Key: Value", where each line is separated by the CRLF combination. If the user input is injected into the value section without properly escaping/removing CRLF characters it is possible to alter the HTTP headers structure.
HTTP Response Splitting is a new application attack technique which enables various new attacks such as web cache poisoning, cross user defacement, hijacking pages with sensitive user information and cross-site scripting (XSS). The attacker sends a single HTTP request that forces the web server to form an output stream, which is then interpreted by the target as two HTTP responses instead of one response.
