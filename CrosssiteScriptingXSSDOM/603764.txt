Summary:
Due to incomplete origin validation, DOM-based XSS was possible at https://inventory.upserve.com/login/ when receiving a postMessage.
#Description
DOM based XSS is possible at https://inventory.upserve.com/login/ due to insecure origin checking when receiving a postMessage.

#POC
1. Visit https://hq.upserve.com.████████/upserve_xss.html
2. Click link
3. View alert on https://inventory.upserve.com

#Vulnerable Code
```javascript
window.addEventListener("message", function(e) {
  if (~e.origin.indexOf("https://hq.upserve.com")) {
    if (e.data && typeof e.data == "object") {
      try {
        if (e.data["exec"]) {
          eval(e.data["exec"]);
        }
      } catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
      }
    } else {
      console.log("Non-object passed");
    }
  } else {
    console.log("Incorrect origin: " + e.origin.toString());
    return;
  }
});
```
The origin check simply determines if "https://hq.upserve.com" is anywhere in the origin so an origin like "https://hq.upserve.com.mydomain.com" will pass this check just fine.

## Impact

Due to the page being a login page, login credentials could be logged and stolen when a victim goes to login.
