### Summary

URL display on Gitlab.com is currently broken.

There is a risk of XSS due to double conversion of URLs into links.
However, 12.5 incorporating the fix has not yet been released and is blocked by CSP at gitlab.com.


### Steps to reproduce

1. Login to gitlab.com
2. Create new project
3. Create a file with the following contents as `Gemfile`
4. Previe the  `Gemfile`
5. You can see in the developer tool that javascript execution has been blocked by CSP.

```ruby
gem '<img/src/onerror=alert(location)>', '2'
```


### Examples

The above code is converted to HTML as shown below and connected to XSS via the img tag.

```html
<span class="s1">'<a href="<a href=" https:="" rubygems.org="" gems="" "="">https://rubygems.org/gems/</a><img src="" onerror="alert(location)">" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img/src/onerror=alert(location)&gt;'</span>
```

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

There is a problem with this MR (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/18305/diffs) that was captured by Milestone 12.5.

The issue is here. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/35120

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

It is expected that there will be no processing that links the URL in the screen twice.
Probably this MR. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19464


### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

### Output of checks

This bug only occurs on GitLab.com .

#### Results of GitLab environment info

The 12.5 version has not yet been released and will not occur in other environments.

## Impact

Since gitlab.com is blocked by CSP, there is almost no risk as XSS.
There are dangers of HTML injection and CSS injection.

If this issue is not fixed and a 12.5 release is made, XSS can occur in Gitlab CE / EE.
