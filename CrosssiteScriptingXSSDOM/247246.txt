Summary:

Hello,

there's a dom based xss vulnerability affecting all pages under the domain https://www.grab.com/.
This vulnerability wasn't properly patched so I managed to bypass the regular expressioned that was added into the function.

Vulnerable code:
````
var stripHtml = (function () {
		  var div = document.createElement('div');
		  return function (html) {
		    div.innerHTML = html.replace(/<\/?\w+[^>]*\/?>/g, "");
		    return (div.innerText || div.textContent); // textContent is for firefox
		  };
		})();
``````

visit url above to reproduce.

A screenshot is attached to this report.

cheers,
Mario.
