Summary:

Hello , i am able to create a password with 1000000 words which fully leads to MySQL or server side Denial Of Service attack.

You need to decrease password length :There are two reasons for limiting the password size. For one, hashing a large amount of data can cause significant resource consumption on behalf of the server and would be an easy target for Denial Of Service attack.

Normally all sites have a password minimum to maximum length like 72 words limit or 48 limit to prevent Denial Of Service attack. in my sql but in itbit website there are no limitation.

Thanks,
