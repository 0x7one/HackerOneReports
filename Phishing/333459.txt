Summary:

Hi,
  

I have [posted here](https://github.com/npm/registry/issues/306), but I wanted to make you aware of this easy social engineering trick. I do not want to claim any of these are currently malicious, but it they easily could be.

  

Thanks,

Marc

## Impact

The attacker could do anything...use the postinstall as the user, work the same as steal data, etc.
