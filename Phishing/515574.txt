Hello Security Team,

I found a Vulnerability in your website where in one of your domain https://www.data.gov/labs
there was Description about Simple API in which two links were pointing to https://simple-api.github.io/api-offices/ but after visiting this URL i got an 404 error where it shown like page not found.

Steps were used to claim these repository :-
1. this domain was available to claim.
2. registered for new github account
3. used username "simple-api"
4. created a master-branch of repository with "api-offices"
5. created a simple index.html file.

## Impact

There is impact where when victim visitor's visit the website they see "Simple API" section for information if they click on below options 
1) Source Code and Documentation

they will get into attackers repository, and attacker can upload any malicious content on it which can harm your organisation.
