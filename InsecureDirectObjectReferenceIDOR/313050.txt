Summary:
@harsh13 found an IDOR which leaked `Subscription ID`, `Purchased Date`, `Validity of Zomato Treats`. Thanks @harsh13 for helping us in making @zomato secure :)

Cheers.
The treat subscriptions tab in my profile has an IDOR.

The corresponding api:

POST /php/filter_user_tab_content.php HTTP/1.1
user_id=██████&tab=treat_subscription&order_history_offset=0&order_history_limit=20


You can give any user id and you will be able to see the treat subscriptions of that user.

## Impact

A user can view treat subscriptions of any other user.
