Summary:
An IDOR in the `/p3/drivers/uploadDocument` endpoint on `partners.uber.com` allowed a driver to upload (and overwrite) documents for other drivers on a multi-driver account. In addition to this, there was an access control issue where a driver account could also upload (and overwrite) documents for the multi-driver account administrator. As a result, a driver could potentially escalate privilege to an account administrator.
