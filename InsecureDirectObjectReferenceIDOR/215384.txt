Summary:

Hi @briann and team,

Congratulations on the launch of GitLab 9.0! While exploring Subgroup functionality, I noticed that an unprivileged user can disclose private group names by incrementing the `parent_id` parameter. 

## Proof of Concept
To reproduce this issue, I set up a fresh GitLab 9.0 CE server and created a Private Group using the `root` account. Afterwards, I created an unprivileged user (no group or project assignments) and visited the below URL, disclosing the name of `PrivateGroup`.

Attempting to access the `PrivateGroup` via the standard routes (e.g. Group Page) presents the unprivileged user with the expected 404 page.

```
http://<instance>/groups/new?parent_id=2
```
