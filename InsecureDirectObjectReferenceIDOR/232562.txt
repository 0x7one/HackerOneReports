Summary:

Good afternoon,

The following url https://cuvva-alternate.app.link/ITHZI8FrKB?__branch_flow_type=deepview_tmta&__branch_flow_id=397220061845644344&__branch_desktop_deepview_type=1 can be used to spam phone numbers remotely.

###Example POC:

```
<html>
<form action="https://cuvva-alternate.app.link/ITHZI8FrKB?__branch_flow_type=deepview_tmta&__branch_flow_id=397220061845644344&__branch_desktop_deepview_type=1" method="POST">
						<input name="phone" id="phone" type="text" class="light" value="+44" />
						<button id="phone_submit" class="light">Send</button>
					</form>
</html>	
```

After grabbing the form code I can spam numbers from my desktop, I tested this on my number of course. *No cell phone bills were jacked up during the making of this poc.* :]

1. Enter a known cell phone number.
2. Submit and recieve the download the app text.
3. Continuously refresh the page to keep spamming the number or create a loop with javascript.

###Steps to fix:

- Set a certain number of post requests per IP.
- Set a captcha.
- Set a limit. As of now I don't think there's a limit so this can be a gateway for spamming.

As a side note usually outside source requests are checked by a referrer attribute to make sure It's valid.

 I'm not entirely sure if you have control over this domain but I still wanted Cuvva to be aware of the vulnerability. As being spammed through a Cuvva download link wouldn't sit well with potential customers or their cell phone bill. Please let me know if you have any questions. I'm happy to help!
