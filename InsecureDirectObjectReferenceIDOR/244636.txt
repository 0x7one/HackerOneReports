Summary:

Good evening,

#Vulnerability

I'm able to create accounts with the email verification that originates from the first account I created. After changing the confirm_email request body to a different email.. After I use that verification link that account is now under my control and bypasses authorization.

This is my confirm email link that created the account https://wakatime.com/confirm_email/5e22456d-9aae-4267-b1a9-4315c2605d89/r1ot.netsec@gmail.com/2017-07-01T04:37:42Z/a7872d4231f99dcb53688cfd4aca0e395faa8fb2.

#POC

Originally the post body was going to my main email connected to my Github account F198848  then I changed the post body attribute to ```{"email":"r1ot.netsec@gmail.com"}```

Here's the screenshot of the request saying it was created F198846.

And here's a screenshot of the newly created account F198847.

#Patch

Only allow request to go out that match the originating account for verification.

This could lead to 3rd party account conflicts and takeovers. The alarming thing is that I can authorized outside emails from within my original account bypassing Oauth.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
