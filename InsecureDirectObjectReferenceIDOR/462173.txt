Summary:
This report described some of the behavior of the integration between Dropbox and Dropbox Paper. In particular, when embedding a Dropbox file into Dropbox Paper, this implicitly creates a link to that file (see https://www.dropbox.com/help/files-folders/view-only-access) and embeds it within the document. This behavior matches that of the Dropbox Chooser (https://www.dropbox.com/developers/chooser), and is by design.
