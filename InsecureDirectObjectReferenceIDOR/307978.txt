Summary:
#Issue
The reporter found some inconsistencies related to authorizations and access between family members.

##Fix

The application was fixed in a monthly release.

##Reasoning

The issue was valid and the reporter provided a lot of valuable information for us to go on including traces, screenshots and overall "this does not seem right" -commentary here and there.  The bounty was based on the ability to change information without the other party's consent and the related  privacy issues. 

The fact that this is not widely nor wildly exploitable reduces the impact quite much: one needs to be a customer, one has to have a wife (or a similar entity), the aforementioned entity must have shared insurances or shared access to joint insurances and finally one has to have bad intents towards this aforementioned entity.
