Summary:
@vijay_kumar1110 reported an Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerability on our Exchange app. This issue could have allowed an attacker to iterate over the shops' screenshot IDs in order to enumerate them and obtain a public accessible URL for all the shop screenshots hosted on Exchange, regardless of whether the listings were public or private.

We have fixed the issue by checking whether the shop accessing the screenshots is the owner of them.
